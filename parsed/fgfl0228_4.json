A gas treating slip stream unit will be installed and operated as part of the overall programme. Effluent water slip stream units will also be included.\nProperly designed slip stream units operating on SCGP-1 product streams are cost-effective methods of testing options and acquiring data necessary to design commercial plants with varying environmental constraints and product gas uses.\n\n<a id='636994bd-36bf-4d78-b10d-1f1f18c71bc8'></a>\n\n# Participants\nCombustion Engineering's subsidiary Lummus Crest and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) are jointly participating with Shell companies in the design, construction and operation of SCGP-1. Lummus Crest will provide engineering design and procurement services. EPRI will provide an electric utility industry perspective. Shell Internationale Petroleum, Shell Internationale Research, Deutsche Shell, Shell Oil and Shell Development provided the process design and much of the engineering design information, and will operate and manage the unit and experimental programme.\n\n<a id='1b58d753-5c88-4a59-9ea4-bf5527d79273'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/fgfl0228",

Environmental design\ndata for potential commercial feedstocks\nwill also be acquired. SCGP-1 includes\nequipment for demonstrating several\nprocess optimisations. These will increase\nstream factor and system reliability, and\nreduce capital and operating costs.\nA final objective for SCGP-1 is to move\nfurther along the experience curve, in part\nby developing an experienced operating\nteam and extensive operating know-how,\nwhich will be readily transferable to the\nfirst commercial plant.\n\n<a id='11f1f90c-d413-4d58-80ae-6ecd3553e553'></a>\n\nAt approximately one-fifth the\nanticipated initial commercial module\nsize, SCGP-1 is the most efficient route to\ncommercialisation of the process. It is\nmuch less costly to construct and operate\nthan a full-scale unit and provides the\nopportunity to test process optimisations\nmore readily. The maximum scale-up\nfactor of five for any given piece of\nequipment is well within Shell capabilities;\nthe lower limit on size was actually set by a\nrequirement to demonstrate equipment\nand configurations that would be\nemployed commercially. Many of the\ncomponents will require little or no scaling.\n\n<a id='7321f0ee-0594-4763-b2a0-74074d26adb4'></a>\n\nThe unit will include coal receiving and\npreparation facilities, a high-pressure\ngasifier with high-temperature energy\nrecovery, solids removal, and gas and\nwater treating to provide both clean\nmedium- BTU gas for power generation\nand high-value steam. The unit is\nscheduled for start-up in the first half of\n1987.\n\n<a id='44541cfd-c89c-4a94-bae8-97b0d2ea12bf'></a>\n\nSCGP-1 is designed to gasify feeds\nfrom lignites to bituminous coals. In\nprinciple, other feeds, such as petroleum\ncoke, could also be gasified. Feeds will\nnormally be received by train or truck and\ngasified at rates of about 250 t/d\n(as-received Illinois high sulphur coal) to\n\n<a id='5e57fcb2-64e3-4748-99b6-c3f0c32eef2f'></a>\n\n400 t/d (as-received lignite). The unit is\ncapable of handling feedstocks with up to\n35% moisture, 30% ash and 4% sulphur\nat design gas production rates.\n\n<a id='d3b1f1bf-5d0b-439a-a9b4-ced0940bf2e6'></a>\n\nTreated product gas will contain\napproximately 99% hydrogen and\ncarbon monoxide (nitrogen-free basis),\nless than 160 ppm sulphur compounds,\nand other minor trace components.\nActual nitrogen content in the product\ngas will depend on whether nitrogen or\nanother gas such as recycled product\ngas or carbon monoxide is used as coal\nfeed transport gas.\n\n<a id='a5877716-b0f1-49bd-9d22-acecabe1dd50'></a>\n\nThe Shell Deer Park Manufacturing\nComplex was chosen as the SCGP-1\nlocation primarily because it can make\nuse of the product gas. Also, some of the\nutility requirements can be met by existing\nfacilities.\n\n<a id='421d603e-3428-4bd0-8da2-34250ed6c1ef'></a>\n\nOxygen and nitrogen will be\npurchased. Slag and fly slag produced\nwill be used for road building and other\napplications, while acid gas will be sent to\nthe Deer Park Complex sulphur plant.\nStripped effluent and storm water will be\nsent to the Complex effluent treating\nsystem.\n\n<a id='b6de1c65-974e-4949-87b6-c3e0f7dcafbe'></a>\n\n# Slip stream units\nThe SCGP-1 acid gas removal system is designed to meet very strict environmental regulations.

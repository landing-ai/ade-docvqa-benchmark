Smokers were primarily interested in trying VSSS because friends smoked it, due to promotionals/coupons, and (to a lesser extent) the novelty and attractive packaging. Of those who read or noticed that VSSS had \"low smoke,\" this benefit did not appear to have a major effect on consumer behavior. Reasons for lack of switching related primarily to design differences (e.g., circumference, intensity) from their own brand. They viewed the purpose of VSSS as a cigarette to appeal to female smokers rather than a cigarette that offered reduced visible sidestream. \"Low smoke\" (not necessarily going as far as a 70% reduction) was viewed as positive for the majority; however, one third of this population did not think that this benefit was important. Of those who felt that it was a benefit, they said low smoke might result in less criticism from nonsmoker, as opposed to positive statements. They also perceived a low smoke cigarette--VSSS--as having less lingering odor. Smokers would not switch categories (e.g., tar brand or circumference) or give up taste for this benefit; they are more inclined to consider giving up taste for an odorless or at least a lighter smelling cigarette. The low smoke of VSSS was attributed to the thinness of the cigarette. They said the only way to increase the percent reduction of smoke would be to make VSSS even thinner which did not interest them. Comments about VSSS self-extinguishing in the ashtray--more of an annoyance than a problem--were heard more frequently in the focus groups than in the one-on-one interviews. This may have been a result of group dynamics.\n\n<a id='2df19821-0e92-4437-a171-1e727c1753eb'></a>\n\n# OBJECTIVE\n\nVirginia Slims Superslims were nationally introduced the fourth quarter of 1989.

An iodine intake of 1 \u00b5g/kg body weight is recommended for the prevention of goiter.

The single new addition to the 1974 RDA table\nis the allowance for zinc, 15 mg for adult men and\nwomen. The allowance is based on data from metabolic\nstudies and the average zinc content of mixed diets. An\nadditional 5 mg of zinc is recommended during preg-\nnancy and 10 mg during lactation. In the Middle East,\nzinc deficiency, characterized by hypogonadism and\ndwarfism, has been demonstrated in man. In the U.S.,\nmarginal rather than severe zinc deficiencies are more\nlikely to be evident. Increased zinc intake by persons\nprobably zinc deficient has accelerated wound healing\nand improved taste acuity (1,7).\n\n<a id='aea76577-5c81-4f89-aa50-cefd25cb1944'></a>\n\nChromium.

The protein intake\nin the U.S. generally exceeds the protein RDA; thus the\ntabulated value of 800 mg calcium per day for adults\nis maintained. However, it is acknowledged in the\ntext that less calcium is needed by those persons con-\nsuming proteins in amounts approaching the protein\nRDA. Calcium balance can be attained with calcium in-\ntakes below the RDA. It is noted in the text that about\n85 per cent of the calcium intake in the U.S. is obtained\nfrom milk and dairy products. An additional 400 mg\nof calcium are needed during pregnancy and lactation.\nA calcium-to-phosphate dietary ratio between 2:1 and\n1:2 has previously been recommended; however, ratios\noutside these boundaries are tolerated, provided vitamin\nD intake is sufficient. Except for the young infant, the\nphosphorus RDA is identical to the calcium RDA. A\ncalcium-to-phosphorus ratio of 1.5:1 is recommended\nduring early infancy.\n\n<a id='684fc301-0457-4b9f-ad96-410c6033da1a'></a>\n\nMagnesium. Recent studies support an allowance of 350 mg magnesium for adult males and 300 mg for adult females (1)\u2014recommendations similar to those of 1968 (2). During pregnancy and lactation an additional 150 mg magnesium are recommended.\n\n<a id='7ecd3a98-9cd7-4f71-9ae0-1ce20eecd924'></a>\n\nRDA have been derived only for those trace elements for which sufficient scientific evidence from balance studies and nutritional and epidemiologic surveys is available. The average availability of trace elements from a balanced diet is carefully considered in formulating RDA. Concern is expressed in the text regarding trace element imbalances in the future. The habitual intake of highly refined or fabricated foods could lead to trace element deficiencies. Conversely, exposure to environments contaminated with heavy metals could be toxic. Emphasis is placed on the consumption of a varied and balanced diet to insure an adequate intake of trace elements (1,7).\n\n<a id='9fbcccd7-ca14-4bd6-8512-c7147503b4cd'></a>\n\nIron. The RDA for iron in the 8th edition has been\nmaintained at 10 mg/day for adult males and postmeno-\npausal females and 18 mg/day for women of childbear-\ning age. The significant change in the 1974 RDA is the\nrecommendation for supplemental iron (30 mg to 60 mg)\nfor pregnant women (1).\n\n<a id='5b59e644-68b1-457d-be67-46b7c7f2791b'></a>\n\nCopper. Although a RDA for copper has not been es-\n\n<a id='4b33c01c-675e-4188-84e9-42989ed71f34'></a>\n\ntablished, copper balance is maintained with intakes of 1.3 mg/day for preadolescent girls, 2 mg/day for adults, and 80 \u00b5g/kg/day for infants and children (1,7).\nIodine. An iodine intake of 1 \u00b5g/kg body weight is recommended for the prevention of goiter. Additional iodine is required by growing children and pregnant and lactating women, Iodine intake varies widely; however, to prevent deficiencies it is suggested that only iodized salt be used in the household.\n\n<a id='e46c23b4-4a66-43f7-a7dc-23139e6c1bcc'></a>\n\nFluorine. Fluorine is an essential element although RDA\nhave not been established for this nutrient. The fluorida-\ntion of public water supplies which contain an insufficient\nconcentration of fluorine is endorsed by the Food and\nNutrition Board (1).\n\n<a id='238e66de-5c68-4892-aecc-3f9ec823ff57'></a>\n\nZinc. The single new addition to the 1974 RDA table\nis the allowance for zinc, 15 mg for adult men and\nwomen. The allowance is based on data from metabolic\nstudies and the average zinc content of mixed diets. An\nadditional 5 mg of zinc is recommended during preg-\nnancy and 10 mg during lactation. In the Middle East,\nzinc deficiency, characterized by hypogonadism and\ndwarfism, has been demonstrated in man. In the U.S.,\nmarginal rather than severe zinc deficiencies are more\nlikely to be evident. Increased zinc intake by persons\nprobably zinc deficient has accelerated wound healing\nand improved taste acuity (1,7).\n\n<a id='aea76577-5c81-4f89-aa50-cefd25cb1944'></a>\n\nChromium. Although a RDA for chromium has not been established, it is essential for man. This trace element probably acts as a cofactor for insulin. Marginal deficiencies of chromium in selected populations are suspect (1).\n\n<a id='6e05f96a-44bc-422e-a204-31bbe2567376'></a>\n\nOTHER NUTRIENTS\n\nOther nutrients not included in the table but discussed in the text are: water, vitamin K, biotin, choline, pantothenic acid, sodium, potassium, chloride, and trace elements such as cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, nickel, tin, vanadium, and silicon (1).\n\n<a id='85cb700f-f509-49be-8392-0777c4b0debc'></a>\n\nAcknowledgments: The National Dairy Council assumes the re-\nsponsibility for writing and editing this publication.

Please make every attempt to line up your wholesalers to promote during this time. Note: If, for some reason, your Wholesale Account cannot promote their Forsyth brand during this period, the account may work the Labor Day Promotion in a four-week period (consecutive weeks) prior to October 2, 1998.\n\n<a id='859877b1-bb38-4580-b981-9b02ef2cc2e0'></a>\n\n**Eligible Participants:** Contracted Forsyth Private Label Wholesale Partners.\n**Promotion Intent:** Reduce Forsyth brands' retail selling price by $1.00-$1.50 per carton/$.10-$.15 per\npack below its everyday retail price for 4.4 weeks (targeted time period August 10-September 4) giving it a\n$3.50-$4.00 per carton spread versus non-promoted Branded Savings price (assumes a minimum of\n$2.50 per carton off-invoice plus $1.00-$1.50 buydown = $3.50-$4.00).\n\n<a id='8f32be21-f99e-446a-b101-539407cef049'></a>\n\nPromotion Details: Forsyth Tobacco Products will support the Labor Day Promotion by adding $.50 per carton to participating contracted **Wholesale** Account's Alliance Accrual Fund if Account agrees to match from its existing Alliance Accrual balance at an additional $.50 or $1.00 per carton. Forsyth's contribution is based on an average of 4 weeks' volume calculated on shipments to direct accounts for the 13-week timeframe of March 1998 to May 1998.\n\n<a id='cbda51e7-d379-4093-b4cf-0798711dcf8d'></a>\n\n1. $.50 Contracted <u>Wholesale Partner Match</u>\nA contracted **Wholesale** Account that has less than 4 months of accrual in its Alliance Accrual Fund as noted on its allocation sheet (example, Attachment I), based on an average accrual rate of $.55 per carton, may match at the minimum of $.50 rate (Forsyth commits $.50 plus **Wholesale Partner** commits $.50 equals $1.00 reduction). Even if a Wholesale Account has <u>no</u> money in its Alliance Accrual Fund, it <u>can</u> participate based on either of the following reasons:\n\n- A Forsyth contracted Wholesale Partner can participate based on the accrual that will be earned on the promoted product sold.\n- If a Forsyth contracted Wholesale Partner has changed its off-invoice status after July 1, 1998, to $3.00 or $3.05 and does not have existing accrual funds necessary to match our $.50 contribution, it may participate in the promotion without matching if it uses all monies in reducing everyday pricing.\n\n<a id='6485f225-e60f-4e22-aff1-00a3c85c256b'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/gjhp0000\n\n<a id='3c9060e0-bbad-450e-93d4-9e3a1984b550'></a>\n\n51840 9311",

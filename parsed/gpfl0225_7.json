Our target group includes all adult tobacco consumers.\n\n<a id='4cef9a53-27cf-4c6b-bb8f-6ccf43b7622b'></a>\n\n## General - Product\n\nQ: How do you use Camel Snus?\nA: Simply slip the packet in the side of your mouth between the lip and gum. A single pouch can last up to one hour. In focus-group testing, adult consumers told us the preferred amount of time to keep the packet in their mouth was anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes.\n\nQ: Is Camel Snus like Skoal or other smokeless tobacco products?\nA: No it is not. Unlike those products, Camel Snus does not require the consumer to spit. Additionally, Camel Snus is not available in a loose format. It's also made differently. It has less salt and less moisture content that other moist snuff. It is also pasteurized, while most moist snuff is fermented.\n\nQ: Can you swallow your saliva/snus packet?\nA: Unlike other smokeless tobacco products, Camel Snus does not require the consumer to spit, so you can swallow the saliva.\n\nQ: What does it taste like? How long do you keep it in your mouth?\nA: It has a tobacco taste. People usually keep a pouch in the mouth from 10 to 30 minutes.\n\nQ: How many do people typically use in a day?\nA: That is difficult to predict as tobacco use varies by consumer.\n\n<a id='fecc78aa-8dcb-48bf-a0b8-4963e254fc2b'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/gpfl0225\n\n<a id='37bbea76-d6e5-43ff-8f59-4d71ce5a9a51'></a>\n\n55824 1425",

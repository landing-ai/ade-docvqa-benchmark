We must avoid at-\ntempts to impose our own eating\npatterns on others. Some examples\nof our misjudgments are:\n\n<a id='e1e32688-44db-4698-87f2-7e3bbf950a2d'></a>\n\n1. Trying to give liquid milk to countries unaccustomed to \"drinking\" their food.\n2. Deploring a breakfast of fried potatoes, sauerkraut, and sausage versus one cup of cocoa and a sweet roll.\n3. Over-emphasizing \"togetherness\" versus \"independence\".\n4. Considering that a soft cooked egg is better for breakfast than a baked custard.\n5. Forgetting that citrus fruit can be just as valuable for lunch as for breakfast.\n\n<a id='625a51c2-cc77-4341-9b19-407c6b2f6661'></a>\n\n<::A black and white portrait of a woman with short, curly hair, wearing glasses, a necklace, and a collared jacket over a patterned top.

We also need to\ndevelop judgment so we can adjust\nour habits and make good choices\nwhen the need arises.\n\n<a id='c21a1fa4-1fe3-4e60-9fff-4b6d225e4dd2'></a>\n\n## Our Strengths\n\nOne of our strengths is the ap-\npreciation of the fact that many\npeople do have good food habits and\neat well. Research statistics should\nbe presented with a positive ap-\nproach.\nEmphasizing many are\ngetting proper foods may be more\neffective than emphasizing the few\nwho are not, because it stimulates\nthe others to want to join the ap-\nproved group.\n\nA second strength is our spirit\nof adventure. Our objectives stay\nflexible and we are willing to try\nnew methods and new techniques\nwithout fear of failure.\n\nThe third strength lies in the\n\n<a id='af834c6d-e176-4f57-9ad1-1e33bda9d635'></a>\n\n13\n\n<a id='32954486-e5cf-4d5d-b0a6-3245af663fdd'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/hthg0227",

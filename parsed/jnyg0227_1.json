Members of the Board and its committees serve without compensation beyond their actual expenses. Financial support for the meetings and publications of the Board has been provided primarily from private sources such as the Milbank Memorial Fund, the Nutrition Foundation, and the Williams-Waterman Fund of the Research Corporation. Grants for the work of the Food and Nutrition Board are received and administered by the National Academy of Sciences. Established by Act of Congress in 1863, the Academy is a private non-profit organization of scientists dedicated to the furtherance of science and to its use for the general welfare. Pursuant to a request made by President Wilson in 1916, the Academy organized the National Research Council.\n\n<a id='167b5acf-a19b-42ba-9d81-ccd26e17f125'></a>\n\nFood and Nutrition Board\nNATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES\u2014\nNATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL\n\n<a id='81548624-a41c-4db2-b204-246b5e0dc20a'></a>\n\nPublications\nIn Print\n\n<a id='03b51f72-7165-489c-abe9-32cbacf6b670'></a>\n\nDecember 1954\n\n<a id='064987ac-67e0-41be-b312-1ca383120c0e'></a>\n\n<::An icon depicting a stack of three stylized books or documents, with lines on the covers suggesting text.\n: figure::>\n\n<a id='0d97a162-2bb9-44f1-b45d-56312e1dac05'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/jnyg0227",

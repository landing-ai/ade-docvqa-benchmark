Yet the Indian economy posted a remarkable recovery not only in terms of overall growth rate but more importantly in terms of its fundamentals which justify belief in India's promising future. The Indian economy's escape from the global financial contagion was mainly due to its robust foundations, and its banking sector remaining largely unexposed to risky assets, as had been financed in advanced economies. The Indian system has focused on deposit-based banking as opposed to being based on banks' short-term borrowings from capital markets.\n\n<a id='c8aaceec-eb8d-4da0-b78a-d312d6d173e2'></a>\n\nThe economy is expected to grow by 8.7% in 2010-11, with a return to a growth rate of 9% in 2011-12. This outlook would be based on an escalation in investment demand, signs of recovery in the global economy and the positive effects of carrying out critical fiscal reforms such as the transition to Goods and Service Tax (GST) and broader direct tax reforms by 2010-11 to fuel growth. In fact the optimists predict that the economy will soon breach the double digit growth mark to become one of the fastest growing economies of the world.\n\n<a id='0186a4bd-9d8a-4d2a-8716-c24a6422c509'></a>\n\n## TOBACCO INDUSTRY\n\nThe Economic Survey 2009-10 indicated that with growth in private expenditure on food, beverages and tobacco falling behind the overall growth in private consumption expenditure, the share of expenditure on food items has gradually been declining over the years.

The Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers continues consultations on compensation to states, subsumation of state taxes, Constitutional amendments and model legislation for GST, amongst other issues.\n\n<a id='7e910218-1f50-4e46-bdfe-1a974805c41e'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/jybx0223",

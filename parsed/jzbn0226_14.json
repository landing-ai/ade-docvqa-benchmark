EPA's Proposed Use of the Pre-Prioritization Step to Gather Information for Risk Evaluations Needs to Be Better Supported and Articulated\n\nOne of the most surprising elements of EPA's proposed prioritization process rule was the discussion of its plans to use a pre-prioritization step to gather information for risk evaluations on substances with \u201cinsufficient information\u201d for risk evaluation. 17 EPA has authority under Section 8 of TSCA to gather existing information about chemicals and under Section 4 to develop new information when needed for risk evaluations. EPA's plan to address risk evaluation information needs, even before a chemical is prioritized, raises several significant concerns, however. First, the proposal has the potential to create \"fishing expeditions\" for data. Second, it is an unrealistic expectation for EPA to think it could know at the pre-prioritization stage what information it might need to begin gathering/requiring for risk evaluation \u2013 well before it has even designated the chemical as a high priority. Finally, EPA has failed to discuss the limitations in Section 4 on EPA's authority to require industry to develop new information for risk evaluations (e.g. EPA must issue statements of need). ACC's concerns are exacerbated by the fact that EPA's discussion of this proposed activity during the pre-prioritization step is vague.\n\n<a id='7db5c46b-6a86-4d20-bacc-2029c83d5b30'></a>\n\n17 \"For chemicals with insufficient information to conduct a risk evaluation, EPA generally expects to pursue a significant amount of data gathering before initiating prioritization.\" 82 Fed.

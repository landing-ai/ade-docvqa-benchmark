Public input at pre-prioritization step\n\nEPA requests comment on whether and how EPA should solicit additional input at the pre-prioritization phase.\" Response: It is not only appropriate, but well advised for EPA to solicit public input at each stage of the prioritization process. From a \u201cdata quality\u201d perspective it is important for the public to have the opportunity to comment on the data/information that EPA believes is relevant to prioritization of chemicals for risk evaluation. As discussed in our comments above, ACC believes EPA must take a sequenced, step-wise approach to gathering available information and/or developing new information in the pre- prioritization stage. It makes sense for EPA to first gather reasonably available information, then solicit public input to identify additional data/information from stakeholders, on a voluntary basis. Then EPA should use reporting tools under Section 8 for additional existing information if needed. Only after using these approaches should the Agency consider ordering the development of new information for prioritization purposes, subject to the requirements of LCSA Section 4.\n\n<a id='ff618dbd-f5b1-453a-9be6-a61281cf9c3a'></a>\n\nD. Consideration of substitutes in pre-prioritization\n\nEPA asks \"whether and how information on the availability of chemical substitutes should be taken into account during this phase [pre-prioritization] of the prioritization process\". Response: Substitutes are not relevant to and should not be considered in the prioritization process. Both the LCSA and EPA's proposed prioritization process rule (at 702.11(b)) make clear that EPA cannot consider \"non-risk factors\" as part of prioritization. The availability of \"substitutes\" is a \"non-risk factor.\" Alternatives can certainly be taken into account in the risk management stage, after the risk evaluation, but do not have a role in the prioritization process.\n\n<a id='7af8062b-1eb5-4f6e-935d-d2b69aef53cc'></a>\n\n21\n\n<a id='05749392-aa46-4602-acb3-ade8da18a168'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/jzbn0226",

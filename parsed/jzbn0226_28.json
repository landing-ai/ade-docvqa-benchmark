Introduction\nThis document provides background on ACC's approach to chemical prioritization screening. The approach is based on the following general principles:\n\n*   The purpose of this approach is to identify substances as priority to receive more detailed evaluation and assessment which, when conducted, could possibly lead to risk management measures.\n*   Apply a science- and risk-based approach, considering both the degree of hazard and extent of exposure potential in setting priorities.\n*   Include criteria applicable to the range of chemicals being screened. Apply this principle through a two-step process rather than just those information elements available only for subsets of chemicals.\n*   Leverage available data and existing hazard classification frameworks already in use across industry and agreed by regulators.\n*   Incorporate relevant science advances where there is broad acceptance in the scientific community, e.g. improvements in how persistence and bioaccumulation considerations are addressed.\n*   Allow for the incorporation of significant new information to ensure prioritization decisions remain current.\n*   Adopt a simple, transparent screening method.\n*   Include opportunity for public review and comment to ensure the best available data and information is used in prioritization decisions.\n*   Allow professional judgment to be applied where appropriate, e.g. in hazard classification and second-tier ranking.\n\n<a id='a3c99312-c3f5-4381-b084-e0ca8183cf46'></a>\n\nII. Applying Initial Screening Step in ACC's Prioritization Approach\n\nThe first step in applying ACC's prioritization approach is to apply criteria on human health and environmental toxicity potential to chemical substances.\n\n<a id='54b82650-7f87-453b-9d18-96ccb7e6432d'></a>\n\nA. Hazard Potential\n\nThe U.N. Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling (GHS) was developed and internationally agreed to by many governments to provide criteria and a consistent approach for hazard classification of chemicals. It can also provide a recognized and generally accepted method for sorting chemicals in a prioritization process. The GHS framework has been used by international bodies, such as the OECD and WHO, and was endorsed by EPA's National Pollution Prevention and Toxics Advisory Committee (NPPTAC) to support prioritization.\n\n<a id='ba09785b-4807-4fa6-9dc6-dfa551209c39'></a>\n\nThe GHS system applies to both human health and ecological endpoints. It includes criteria for both human and ecological health. For human health, criteria are available for both acute and chronic classifications, as well as CMR categorization.

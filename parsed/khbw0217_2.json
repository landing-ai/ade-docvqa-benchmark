A managed care elasticity study completed in 2000, looking at Prempro pricing, indicated that the list price could be increased to $29.00 for a month supply without raising strong resistance from managed care. The direct price for a month supply as of March 2001 is $24.97 and $22.80 for Prempro and Premphase respectively.\n\n<a id='57b62787-e40a-43dd-b599-cd6e0980d502'></a>\n\n**Average Selling Price:** The weighted ASP is listed below. The increase in gross ASP is consistent with catalog price increases; the increase in net ASP is also influenced by a relative decrease in sales deductions.\n\n<a id='5aaaf0da-4144-4968-86b2-8e8f5efd1d49'></a>\n\n<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>2000</th><th>1999</th><th>Change</th><th>% Change</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gross ASP per Tablet</td><td>$0.7331</td><td>$0.6313</td><td>$0.1017</td><td>16.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Net ASP per Tablet</td><td>0.6697</td><td>0.5728</td><td>0.0969</td><td>16.9%</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<a id='4ceae6e2-ef20-463d-a530-9b2777225092'></a>\n\n**Terms of Sale:** All classes of trade receive terms of 2% 30; net 31 days.\n\n<a id='7d4cb53e-a852-4b36-8347-cbc0530cf1f9'></a>\n\n1.16 Reimbursement Strategy and Action Plan\n\n<a id='7497cfaa-90ce-4e24-b3d3-5621c3fea734'></a>\n\nAlthough a variety of ERT/HRT products are reimbursed in the United States, cost concerns remain an important consideration in the ERT/HRT market. Inexpensive drugs such as Premarin appear on most formularies, approximately 99% with Prempro on approximately 96% of all formularies across the United States. Pricier drugs, such as raloxifene and some transdermal products, are less likely to be reimbursed. As a consequence, the bottom line for third-party payers, physicians, and patients themselves, will always factor into prescribing and consumption patterns in the ERT/HRT market. Pricing of new drugs must therefore remain competitive in each of the major markets if newer agents are to gain patient and clinician acceptance.\n\n<a id='885c4f08-1c1e-4358-a85f-e4db55dd02eb'></a>\n\nManaged care organizations have made strong inroads in serving both the Medicare and non-Medicare populations in the United States. Managed care is a mixed blessing with regard to the future of ERT/HRT in the United States. In the short term, cost constraints may initially depress the market prospects of higher-cost products. In the long run, however, the trend toward preventive strategies and the expected positive results of major trials (e.g. WHI, WISDOM, and RUTH) could pay off for therapies that offer a proven preventive benefit as well as symptom relief.\n\n<a id='46f672e6-575b-4dbd-9009-2ad77b1b7a31'></a>\n\n## 6.

The activities and teaching suggestions are designed to improve students' decision-making skills by helping them analyze the beliefs and personal values which guide the decisions they make. The research on which the materials are based makes it clear that students are not only willing to talk about moral dilemmas or conflicts in a non-threatening environment, but that such discussions and related activities help them develop a deeper understanding of the decision-making process.\n\n<a id='3e9b5573-5951-439c-accf-e9af2f80f9f2'></a>\n\nAn important first step is to gain a sense of how your students currently perceive some of society's core values, such as honesty and responsibility. Research indicates that young people and their parents often have different ideas of what such value concepts mean. By examining ways in which their perceptions differ from those of their parents, students and their families can avoid a good deal of misunderstanding. At the same time, this process of taking stock will help you recognize where the areas of confusion or inconsistency are in the value frameworks your students have constructed.\n\n<a id='15830944-e2c4-43e0-a768-a9b8d76f1b8d'></a>\n\nThis program is designed to provide\nstudents with gulded experiences in\nanalyzing the role of personal values in\ndecision-making. Students will recognize\nthat underlying all of the complex and\ndifficult decisions they face is a basic\nconflict of values. Making a decision\ninvolves making a choice \u2014 deciding that\none personal value is more important than\nanother, at least in that particular situation.\n\n<a id='061dc898-319d-4641-8d76-6408050ecff5'></a>\n\nFor early adolescents, these conflicts often\ninvolve making a choice between what the\nperson believes to be right and the\ndemands of friendship. Because friend-\nship is so powerful and pervasive for this\nage group, we have not treated it as a\nseparate value. Instead, It should be seen\nas a potent force that can influence or\ncomplicate decision making; In fact, many\nteens operate according to a dual set of\nvalues --- one set for friends, another for\nall other relationships.

While it is neither wise nor feasible to\ndictate codes of conduct, it is important to\nkeep students from adopting a value\nsystem in which anything goes as long as\nfriends approve. The goal is to guide them\nin exploring real-life conflict and helping\nthem to see that a more consistent frame\nof values will enable them to make more\neffective and, in the long run, more\nsatisfying decisions.\n\n<a id='b9bdaa44-fafe-418d-bf4b-73f915ee62c8'></a>\n\n**INTENDED AUDIENCE**\nThis program has been designed to be\nused with students in grades 6-9. The\nmaterials can be incorporated into\nguidance programs or classes such as\nsocial studies, health or life skills.\n\n<a id='080660e5-ab9c-44d1-88f8-b1ca123c3ddf'></a>\n\n## OBJECTIVES\nThis fourth unit of the RIGHT DECISIONS,\nRIGHT NOW program is designed to help\nstudents:\n\n- work in groups to define certain value\nconcepts and, through discussion, see\nif they can agree on definitions.\n- determine which values are most\nImportant to them.\n- discuss key values with their parents\nor guardians.\n- recognize that the decisions they make\nare guided by their personal frame-\nworks of values.\n- examine the values involved in a\nvariety of situations that reflect their\nreal-life concerns.\n- understand that people's words and\nactions often reveal the values they\nregard as most important.\n- use role-playing scenarios to under-\nstand the thoughts and feelings of\nboth sides in conflict situations.\n- strengthen their capacity for reasoning\nbased on sound values.\n- understand that they can help each\nother in making and sticking to tough\ndecisions.\n\n<a id='0139d1a2-8d73-44b8-817c-4b41edf4fc2f'></a>\n\nPROGRAM COMPONENTS\n1. Four activity masters to reproduce as individual and group worksheets.\n2. This teacher's guide which contains:\n   - Background information.\n\n<a id='af70c680-5de1-49ab-b423-68440b73c030'></a>\n\n- Suggestions for presenting each activity.\n- Ideas for extending each activity.\n- A list of resources.\n3. A full-color poster that encourages students to think about the personal values underlying the decisions they make.\n4. A teacher response card that allows you to comment on the program.\n\n<a id='f5f0707e-44fd-4357-b075-812038ca472d'></a>\n\n# IMPLEMENTING\n# THE PROGRAM\n\n## Classroom Environment\nAn important element in the success of all the activities is the classroom environment you are able to establish. If students feel they are being judged or evaluated, they will slip into the \"right answer\" mode, giving responses they think an adult expects to hear. Your own teaching style is the most effective way of assuring the class that this is not a test situation.\n\n<a id='20a2ae89-1798-4c79-8d01-855fbbd4d41d'></a>\n\n## Group Work\nThe activities are designed for students to work on together in groups of 6-8. You can have students remain in the same group throughout the program or change groups for each activity. Each group will have a group leader and a recorder. These positions should change each time, with the recorder reporting the group's conclusions to the class. Group leaders need to keep the group focused and working. The following rules should be established by the leader prior to any discussion.\n1. Members are allowed to pass if they feel uncomfortable with specific topics.\n2. No put-downs are allowed.\n3. Everyone has to take a turn talking.\n4. Any answer is an appropriate answer and worth discussing.\n\n<a id='4c49e082-6d96-4a24-839d-21f3f9359c24'></a>\n\nPoster\nThe poster contains a list of the values that\nare focused on in this program. Use the\nposter to introduce the program, explaining\nto students that their decisions are guided\nby their personal values. Encourage\nstudents to think about the values they\nbelieve are important and to use these\nvalues to help them make the right\ndecisions, right now.\n\n<a id='697c1678-70cf-4775-9c03-54de8e1440b6'></a>\n\n( 52204 2531",

The activities and teaching suggestions are designed to improve students' decision-making skills by helping them analyze the beliefs and personal values which guide the decisions they make. The research on which the materials are based makes it clear that students are not only willing to talk about moral dilemmas or conflicts in a non-threatening environment, but that such discussions and related activities help them develop a deeper understanding of the decision-making process.\n\n<a id='3e9b5573-5951-439c-accf-e9af2f80f9f2'></a>\n\nAn important first step is to gain a sense of how your students currently perceive some of society's core values, such as honesty and responsibility. Research indicates that young people and their parents often have different ideas of what such value concepts mean. By examining ways in which their perceptions differ from those of their parents, students and their families can avoid a good deal of misunderstanding. At the same time, this process of taking stock will help you recognize where the areas of confusion or inconsistency are in the value frameworks your students have constructed.\n\n<a id='15830944-e2c4-43e0-a768-a9b8d76f1b8d'></a>\n\nThis program is designed to provide\nstudents with gulded experiences in\nanalyzing the role of personal values in\ndecision-making. Students will recognize\nthat underlying all of the complex and\ndifficult decisions they face is a basic\nconflict of values. Making a decision\ninvolves making a choice \u2014 deciding that\none personal value is more important than\nanother, at least in that particular situation.\n\n<a id='061dc898-319d-4641-8d76-6408050ecff5'></a>\n\nFor early adolescents, these conflicts often\ninvolve making a choice between what the\nperson believes to be right and the\ndemands of friendship. Because friend-\nship is so powerful and pervasive for this\nage group, we have not treated it as a\nseparate value. Instead, It should be seen\nas a potent force that can influence or\ncomplicate decision making; In fact, many\nteens operate according to a dual set of\nvalues --- one set for friends, another for\nall other relationships. Lying, for example,\nis perceived as wrong, but lying to protect\na friend is not.\n\n<a id='2628c09a-c401-417e-acfe-761c783da160'></a>\n\nYour role is vital in helping students\nanalyze and strengthen the framework of\npersonal values by which they currently\nlive. While it is neither wise nor feasible to\ndictate codes of conduct, it is important to\nkeep students from adopting a value\nsystem in which anything goes as long as\nfriends approve. The goal is to guide them\nin exploring real-life conflict and helping\nthem to see that a more consistent frame\nof values will enable them to make more\neffective and, in the long run, more\nsatisfying decisions.\n\n<a id='b9bdaa44-fafe-418d-bf4b-73f915ee62c8'></a>\n\n**INTENDED AUDIENCE**\nThis program has been designed to be\nused with students in grades 6-9. The\nmaterials can be incorporated into\nguidance programs or classes such as\nsocial studies, health or life skills.\n\n<a id='080660e5-ab9c-44d1-88f8-b1ca123c3ddf'></a>\n\n## OBJECTIVES\nThis fourth unit of the RIGHT DECISIONS,\nRIGHT NOW program is designed to help\nstudents:\n\n- work in groups to define certain value\nconcepts and, through discussion, see\nif they can agree on definitions.\n- determine which values are most\nImportant to them.\n- discuss key values with their parents\nor guardians.\n- recognize that the decisions they make\nare guided by their personal frame-\nworks of values.\n- examine the values involved in a\nvariety of situations that reflect their\nreal-life concerns.\n- understand that people's words and\nactions often reveal the values they\nregard as most important.\n- use role-playing scenarios to under-\nstand the thoughts and feelings of\nboth sides in conflict situations.\n- strengthen their capacity for reasoning\nbased on sound values.\n- understand that they can help each\nother in making and sticking to tough\ndecisions.\n\n<a id='0139d1a2-8d73-44b8-817c-4b41edf4fc2f'></a>\n\nPROGRAM COMPONENTS\n1. Four activity masters to reproduce as individual and group worksheets.\n2. This teacher's guide which contains:\n   - Background information.\n\n<a id='af70c680-5de1-49ab-b423-68440b73c030'></a>\n\n- Suggestions for presenting each activity.\n- Ideas for extending each activity.\n- A list of resources.\n3. A full-color poster that encourages students to think about the personal values underlying the decisions they make.\n4. A teacher response card that allows you to comment on the program.\n\n<a id='f5f0707e-44fd-4357-b075-812038ca472d'></a>\n\n# IMPLEMENTING\n# THE PROGRAM\n\n## Classroom Environment\nAn important element in the success of all the activities is the classroom environment you are able to establish. If students feel they are being judged or evaluated, they will slip into the \"right answer\" mode, giving responses they think an adult expects to hear. Your own teaching style is the most effective way of assuring the class that this is not a test situation.\n\n<a id='20a2ae89-1798-4c79-8d01-855fbbd4d41d'></a>\n\n## Group Work\nThe activities are designed for students to work on together in groups of 6-8. You can have students remain in the same group throughout the program or change groups for each activity. Each group will have a group leader and a recorder. These positions should change each time, with the recorder reporting the group's conclusions to the class. Group leaders need to keep the group focused and working. The following rules should be established by the leader prior to any discussion.\n1. Members are allowed to pass if they feel uncomfortable with specific topics.\n2. No put-downs are allowed.\n3. Everyone has to take a turn talking.\n4. Any answer is an appropriate answer and worth discussing.\n\n<a id='4c49e082-6d96-4a24-839d-21f3f9359c24'></a>\n\nPoster\nThe poster contains a list of the values that\nare focused on in this program. Use the\nposter to introduce the program, explaining\nto students that their decisions are guided\nby their personal values. Encourage\nstudents to think about the values they\nbelieve are important and to use these\nvalues to help them make the right\ndecisions, right now.\n\n<a id='697c1678-70cf-4775-9c03-54de8e1440b6'></a>\n\n( 52204 2531",

They are usually paid on the first of the month, with many associations charging a late fee to those owners who do not pay on time. Both maintenance fees and special assess-ments are a legal obligation of the own-er to the association, and failure to pay will usually result in a lien being placed on the property.\n\n<a id='7f6bcd45-8e2e-4c58-89fa-e796d997bfd0'></a>\n\nMaintenance fees can be held down\nby good resident managers and manag-\ning agents in some of the following ways:\n- All common area lights should be\non timers;\n\n<a id='4dd0845d-99a1-4321-801d-e487de452315'></a>\n\n\u2014Pool motors should also be on\ntimers, or adjusted manually to com-\npensate for more or less usage;\n\u2014Contracts for services such as sew-\nage treatment, plant maintenance\nand refuse service should be reviewed\nand re-bid periodically;\n\n<a id='1c85883d-8f79-4c6e-9f33-14836e5dcbbf'></a>\n\n\u2014Insurance is a major expense and\nshould be reviewed both for cost and\nadequacy of coverage.\n\n<a id='c31ff1f5-d40a-4459-a6e7-a2ea29c11f0c'></a>\n\nYour managing agent, board of direc-\ntors and general membership must all\nwork together to insure the smooth-\nworking relationship necessary for an\neconomically well-run and efficient con-\ndominium project.\n\n<a id='bee4b088-049e-4d4b-be10-49a22be448b7'></a>\n\n40\n\n<a id='590d2333-3630-4e00-9f69-1223a10ba163'></a>\n\nLatitude 20/November 1978",

Comment Period on Manufacturer Requested Evaluations\n\nOnce EPA receives a manufacturer request for a risk evaluation and deems it to be valid, EPA proposes a comment period of no less than 30 calendar days. ACC is concerned that this open-ended comment period could potentially delay EPA's determinations. Based on EPA's proposal, a valid manufacturer request will need to contain all the exposure and hazard information for multiple conditions of use. The information presented will be similar to what EPA would present in a draft scoping evaluation. As such, ACC recommends that EPA align this comment period with the comment period provided for the draft scoping evaluation.

The Risk Evaluation Process\n\nIn describing what the risk evaluation process will look like under the LCSA, compared to previous assessments, EPA notes that key differences include considerations of conditions of use, timelines, and determinations of unreasonable risk.68 While these are indeed new considerations, EPA fails to mention the importance of relying on best available science and using a WoE approach, which should incorporate systematic review practices. ACC believes that these requirements, from Section 26 of the LCSA, do indeed require a new risk evaluation process-one that is much more transparent, objective and reproducible.

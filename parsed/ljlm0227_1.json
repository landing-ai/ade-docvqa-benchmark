This letter should clearly state how the nominee's three publications (see Item 9 of the nomination form) meet the requirements of independent investigation. Discuss the role of the nominee in the experimental design, innovation, execution, or interpretation of the data in these publications.\nB. If the publications submitted for Membership Committee review are coauthored by investigators with experience or rank equivalent to or greater than that of the candidate, either the sponsors' letters or separate letters from the coauthors must detail the individual contribution of the candidate to the work described in these publications.\nC. If the nominee is not the senior author of the publications cited, describe the role of the other authors. Discuss why these papers demonstrate independent investigation by the nominee.\nD. If the articles cited are not in refereed journals, cite reasons why they should be considered as significant research articles. This is particularly important for individuals in nutrition-affiliated fields (e.g., nutritional anthropology).\nE. If the individual is being nominated on the basis of superior service to nutrition, the letters of nomination should emphasize the benefits of the nominee's work in nutrition to society at large.

This letter should clearly state how the nominee's three publications (see Item 9 of the nomination form) meet the requirements of independent investigation. Discuss the role of the nominee in the experimental design, innovation, execution, or interpretation of the data in these publications.\nB. If the publications submitted for Membership Committee review are coauthored by investigators with experience or rank equivalent to or greater than that of the candidate, either the sponsors' letters or separate letters from the coauthors must detail the individual contribution of the candidate to the work described in these publications.\nC. If the nominee is not the senior author of the publications cited, describe the role of the other authors. Discuss why these papers demonstrate independent investigation by the nominee.\nD. If the articles cited are not in refereed journals, cite reasons why they should be considered as significant research articles. This is particularly important for individuals in nutrition-affiliated fields (e.g., nutritional anthropology).\nE. If the individual is being nominated on the basis of superior service to nutrition, the letters of nomination should emphasize the benefits of the nominee's work in nutrition to society at large. Usual service to the nominee's employer and/or organization is not a sufficient criterion.\n\n<a id='dd800340-bcb5-4f58-872c-5e08be69f361'></a>\n\nF. If this is a nomination for simultaneous membership in AIN and ASCN, this letter should identify the nominee's meritorious research in clinical nutrition.\n\n<a id='4b7b60cf-cf17-4d2a-8ff7-a7115bb193b8'></a>\n\nText of Letter (Use additional pages as needed)\n\n<a id='361ef738-e404-4efa-9f41-14e7722b07b9'></a>\n\nIt is with the greatest enthusiasm that I join in sponsoring the nomination of Dr. Josip Matovinovic for membership in the American Institute of Nutrition and the American Society for Clinical Nutrition. My acquaintanceship with Dr. Matovinovic dates from about 1949 or 1950 when, as a consultant for the World Health Organization on nutrition in Yugoslavia, I had the opportunity of meeting this remarkable, highly able young physician-scientist. During the post-World War II period Josip Matovinovic became the leading scientist in Yugoslavia concerned with endemic goiter and iodine deficiency. He provided the leadership and developed the expertise not only in the field of medicine but in the technology of iodinization to establish the national program of iodinization of salt in that country. This program has profoundly reduced the enormous problem of goiter and cretinism that existed before its initiation.\n\n<a id='2cadd0ed-e211-4d0b-98c9-52ed69d2fabd'></a>\n\nThroughout the period of the 1950's onward, I have subsequently been associated with Josip Matovinovic in activities to which he has given, again, remarkable leadership with the World Health Organization in their program of control of endemic goiter. He was a key figure in developing the first of the WHO international symposia and work groups\n\n<a id='e476b3db-962c-488d-8363-61b5ab2207f2'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/ljlm0227",

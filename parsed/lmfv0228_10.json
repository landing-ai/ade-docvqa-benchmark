And from Dr.\nMilgram's reference to high school and junior high school students\nrises the possibilty of an additional, simultaneous plus. This\nconceivably can come in more suitably directed materials for\npre-college schools as well.\n\n<a id='be010abd-af25-4418-9ef2-34ab13adcd26'></a>\n\nVarious studies have confirmed a close association between drinking in high school and drinking in college. For instance, the highly regarded 1977 survey, Drinking among College Students in New England (H. Wechsler and M. McFadden. Journal of Studies on Alcohol, November, 1979), produced, along with others, these findings:\n\n* Among men, half of those who reported drinking at least once a week in high school were classified as frequent-heavy drinkers in college.\n* Conversely, more than half (59 percent) of those who reported they never drank in high school were classified as abstainers or infrequent-light drinkers in college.\n* Women who said they drank at least once a week in high school were nine times more likely to be classified as frequent -heavy drinkers in college than those who drank less than once a month or not at all.\n* Seventy-one percent of the women who never drank in high school were abstainers or infrequent-light drinkers in college.\n\n<a id='cb352c53-26c4-47ff-89a0-8c3225ba694f'></a>\n\nWith such similarities in drinking patterns between high school and college students, an assumption can be made that materials designed for specific purposes for the latter would have adaptability for the former. Thus the potential exists for a productive interchange which, with pre-college schools, might carry the added benefit of prompting wider adoption of meaningful alcohol-education programs.\n\n<a id='818e156d-9906-401a-a062-c9127030d991'></a>\n\nClearly, then, an opportunity prevails for multiple gains to be\nachieved from the campus workshop-tailoring activity\nnow in progress.\n\n<a id='35ef7d81-dff7-4a14-a3a7-4fa5daf0743a'></a>\n\n8\n\n<a id='e3074747-24dd-42a0-a314-b863e4725c91'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/lmfv0228",

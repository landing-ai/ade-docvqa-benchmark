It is known that in modern metal-on-metal hip implants a fluid film lubrication may occur where a thin microscopic layer of lubricant completely separates the head and cup liner bearing surfaces thus protecting the articulating surfaces during relative motion. By protecting these surfaces, the fluid film lubrication plays a role in reducing the wear of metal-on-metal bearings. The diametrical clearances for the subject liners with compatible femoral head are the same as those for similar size components of the ASR system and the 36 mm Pinnacle metal liner (See Table 1). Therefore, it is expected that the fluid film lubricant layer produced with the subject liners will be the same as that for the previously cleared ASR Modular Acetabular Cup System (K040627) and the 36mm Pinnacle metal liner (K003523) indicating the subject liners will have similar wear rates. This has been confirmed through an in-vitro hip simulator wear test.

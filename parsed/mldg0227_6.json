The suggested recommendations are:\n\n<a id='d1355457-95ab-47b9-81a3-15c041999a74'></a>\n\n1. Three or four regional training centers should be set up during the coming year to train professional, technical, and para-professional assistants in the fields of nutrition, food technology, administration of child feeding programs and/or other disciplines which might be required.\n\n<a id='277ca669-0350-4fc1-b8f8-fe1a4e0605ee'></a>\n\n2. These technical training centers shall be expansions of existing technical centers or educational centers which already have achieved the competency in one or more of these disciplines, e.g. INCAP, National Institute of Nutrition in Bogota, Nutrition Research Center in the Philippines, Department of Nutrition Hebrew University in Jerusalem.\n\n<a id='113696bf-64c8-4656-8682-3d08538b8d86'></a>\n\n3.

The para-professional personnel who may receive one or two years of practical and limited theoretical training--the relation of these two should be at least ten para-professionals to one higher level personnel.\n\n<a id='02b78580-a599-4b4f-86f0-4a1cdcb6601b'></a>\n\n5.

The para-professional personnel who may receive one or two years of practical and limited theoretical training--the relation of these two should be at least ten para-professionals to one higher level personnel.\n\n<a id='02b78580-a599-4b4f-86f0-4a1cdcb6601b'></a>\n\n5. The competent staff in established centers should be augmented by temporary\njunior staff instructors from U.S., recognizing that as the training progresses,\nnationals may take over the work of visiting junior staff.\n\n<a id='807edcc6-49f2-424a-b2a8-95a39f6901a2'></a>\n\n6. The instruction should include practical training involving research for the\nhigher levels of training and experience in local problems for the para-profes-\nsional personnel.\n\n<a id='2f3d726c-2170-443e-9f7d-0826567376da'></a>\n\n7. These training programs should coordinate closely with existing programs such as:\na. the New International Education Act of HEW and its operation;\nb. the USDA training program in home economics;\nc. the interagency training centers such as PAHO and WHO and international agencies.\n\n<a id='0b66dcee-2e59-4265-b992-56b76f08d3c9'></a>\n\n8. Emphasis in training of manpower should be placed on instruction and not on facilities. It is recommended that possibly 75% of the funding be for training and 25% be for physical facilities.\n\n<a id='71a54ece-e583-44a8-acbe-16dc868f56d2'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/mldg0227",

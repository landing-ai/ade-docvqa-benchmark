But this is not what\nhappens in the mouth. In the\nmouth, teeth are exposed to a soft\ndrink for only a very short period\nof time and are constantly bathed\nin a protective wash of saliva,\nwhich acts to decrease the effect\nof the acid.\n\n<a id='c90f6f7d-9f9a-4f9c-b32d-7d2cdc6c0aab'></a>\n\nIn conclusion, you can\nreduce your chances of develop-\ning tooth decay by following a\nfew simple guidelines.\n\n*   Visit your dentist regularly, use\n    fluoride routinely and keep your\n    teeth clean by frequent brushing\n    and flossing.\n*   Decrease the number of times\n    that sticky carbohydrates are\n    eaten. The more frequently\n    these foods are eaten, the more\n    times teeth are subject to condi-\n    tions promoting decay.\n*   Try to limit the consumption\n    of sticky carbohydrates to meal-\n\n<a id='3263ada0-0471-4a2b-943b-53d80600b1b8'></a>\n\ntimes when other foods and\nliquids will help remove them\nfrom the mouth.\n* Rinse your mouth with water\nafter eating if you are unable to\nbrush your teeth.\n* Avoid putting infants and young\nchildren to bed with a bottle\ncontaining sweetened liquids,\nincluding fruit juice, milk or\nformula. The normally rapid\nclearance time of liquids\nthrough the mouth does not\noccur in this situation, and the\nteeth are exposed to the liquid\nfor an extended period of time.\n* Choose a variety of foods from\nall the basic food groups. Eating\nmany different kinds of foods in\nmoderate amounts is the key to\na balanced diet and promotes\ngeneral good health.\nThe Coca-Cola Company\nsupports the need for further\ndental research and educational\nprograms to clarify the facts about\ntooth decay and good dental\nhealth.\n\n<a id='77320cdc-31bf-4e66-97d6-8643c81dd1ff'></a>\n\nFor more technical informa-\ntion on soft drinks and dental\nhealth or other ingredient-related\nquestions, please write or call:\n\n<a id='b6695ec8-9f33-4705-ad44-01e3c5a696c6'></a>\n\nConsumer Information Center\nCoca-Cola USA\nP.O.

We were thus disappointed that the draft Scope does not specifically focus on evaluating cancer and non-cancer health effects in the exposure range relevant to U.S. citizens.

ACC encourages EPA to evaluate and include alternative extrapolation models, including scientifically plausible threshold models for the analysis of cancer data in addition to a default linear model to account for the uncertainties associated with the dose response extrapolation. Such an approach would be consistent with the EPA 2005 Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment as well as the recommendations provided to EPA in the 2011 National Academies Review of the EPA's Draft IRIS Assessment of Formaldehyde. Furthermore, to ensure appropriate context for risk managers and policymakers and to promote a more complete characterization of potential hazards and risks, the scoping document should contain plans for including in the assessment 1) central tendency estimates of dose-response curves in addition to upper bound estimates and 2) a plausibility check to compare the resulting reference values and cancer risk value estimates with data on the actual health outcomes at environmentally relevant levels of exposures.

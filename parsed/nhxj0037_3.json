Attempts to use a more viscous cellulose slurry in order to obtain well-defined bands were not successful. The short distance between the \"daubing dandy\" and the couch roll did not allow for sufficient drainage, and the still wet web continually wound itself around the first press roll. When the cellulose level was cut in half, paper was made successfully. However, band definition was not sufficient. The last attempt utilized a 2% microcrystalline cellulose as the feedstock. Drainage time was adequate for this material, and a considerable amount of paper was run. Band spreading still occurred; however, the resulting paper was clearly banded. For the next trial a second shell will be made with 2 mm instead of 5 mm slits. This change will lead to less band spreading.

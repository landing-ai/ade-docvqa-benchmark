Improvement in energy intensity gradually reaches a sustained 2% p.a. To support a 3% p.a. growth in GDP, primary energy increases at about 1.3% p.a. until 2030, as developing economies expand. Thereafter, energy growth slows down to 1% p.a., as \"Dematerialisation\", started in the more advanced regions of OECD countries, gradually spreads to industrialising and developing countries, once infrastructure has been built and GDP per capita is high enough. Countries restructuring their economies would improve their energy efficiencies drastically.\n\n<a id='968025bb-9f63-4f9f-b541-3ad4aa3e7149'></a>\n\nCoal and oil growth is lower in\n\"Dematerialisation\" than in \"Sustained Growth\".\nHowever, more gas is being used to compensate\nfor the delayed take-off of PV solar, postponed\nfrom 2020 to 2050. This technology remains a\nniche application until nanotechnology becomes\nwidely applicable!\n\n<a id='27c2b101-03b1-41f9-be8a-2f9c3f200214'></a>\n\nA 2% p.a improvement in energy intensity has only been seen for limited periods in the past. In \"Dematerialisation\", relentless advances in information technology, telecommunication, materials and biotechnology would enable high energy intensity improvements to be sustained for several decades.\n\n<a id='25fcf0e4-6e24-407e-aed7-64439d4bd11f'></a>\n\n<::Dematerialisation\n: chart::>\n<::This is a stacked area chart titled \"Dematerialisation\".\nThe y-axis is labeled \"exajoules\" and ranges from 0 to 1500.\nThe x-axis represents years from 1860 to 2060.\n\nThe legend indicates different energy sources, with some represented by unfilled squares and others by filled black squares:\noption Surprise: [ ]\noption Geoth.: [ ]\noption Solar: [ ]\noption Biomass: [ ]\noption Wind: [ ]\noption Nuclear: [ ]\noption Hydro: [x]\noption Gas: [ ]\noption Oil & NGL: [x]\noption Coal: [ ]\noption Trad Bio.: [x]\n\nThe chart shows the contribution of various energy sources to the total exajoules over time. The total exajoules start low in 1860, begin to rise significantly around 1940, and continue to increase, reaching nearly 1000 exajoules by 2060. The largest contributions appear to come from \"Oil & NGL\", \"Coal\", and \"Trad Bio.\" in the later years, with other sources like \"Hydro\", \"Gas\", \"Nuclear\", \"Wind\", \"Biomass\", \"Solar\", \"Geoth.\", and \"Surprise\" also contributing to the total.::>\n\n<a id='0accb92b-d8f5-4f69-bb47-b160e3787f72'></a>\n\nA different life style, possibly linked to changing\nindividuals' and customers' behaviour, could\nemerge. Signs may already be perceivable such as\nvirtual reality, but consequences are difficult to\nanticipate fully, perhaps similar to the scale of\nchanges brought about by the automobile and\nindividual mobility during the 20th century.\n\n<a id='5db1559e-1ac7-4c49-9fd8-b1a87d7c35d8'></a>\n\nIn \"Dematerialisation\", the rate of market\npenetration for identified renewable energy -\nwind, biomass, PV solar - is lower than in\n\"Sustained Growth\". The second wave of\nrenewables is not needed until 2060.\n\n<a id='87942b75-ae0a-4765-91dc-99c7890c1d82'></a>\n\n# Conclusions\n* Hydrocarbons are needed for economic development\n* Productivity improvement in supply and use will continue\n* Energy needs will be met by more diverse sources\n* \"Carbon free\" newcomers can become competitive through market mechanisms. Markets will decide which technology is best.\n* CO2 emissions from fossil fuels peak at around 10 GtC before the middle of the next century and decline to 4GtC/year by 2100, leading to stabilisation of CO2 content in the atmosphere at about 550 - 600 ppm, according to current models, or 60% above today's level.\n\n<a id='0cc9cc90-6ce6-4e2b-8b2e-f6de5e39a531'></a>\n\n<::CO2 Emission - Fossil Fuels chart\n: The chart displays CO2 emissions in G-tonnes C over time, from 1900 to 2100. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 20 G-tonnes C, and the x-axis represents years.\n: Three lines are plotted:\n: 1. A dotted line, labeled \"Climate change panel base case\", shows a continuous increase in CO2 emissions, starting from less than 1 G-tonne C in 1900 and projected to reach over 20 G-tonnes C by 2100.\n: 2. A thin solid line, labeled \"Sustained Growth\", shows emissions increasing from 1900, peaking at approximately 11 G-tonnes C around 2030-2040, and then gradually declining to about 4 G-tonnes C by 2100.\n: 3. A thick solid line, labeled \"Dematerialisation\", shows emissions increasing from 1900, peaking at approximately 10 G-tonnes C around 2020-2030, and then declining more sharply to about 3 G-tonnes C by 2100.::>\n\n<a id='14e16718-24a2-4c10-9a50-c6b3dc024fcd'></a>\n\nAmong many different possible paths along which the world energy system could develop, \"Sustained Growth\" and \"Dematerialisation\" are two sustainable and plausible archetypes which could happen through market mechanisms and with minimum stimulation. These scenarios provide low economic cost options to policy makers and are genuinely \"no regret\".\n\n<a id='4a999b56-e4f1-4d34-b652-30672bf9c75d'></a>\n\nLike 100 years ago, there are many talents in the\nworld. Provided governments maintain a\nframework in which inventiveness, competition\nand productivity are encouraged and rewarded\nand where decisions are the result of a rational\nand open debate, business can do a lot to support\nsustained economic growth, supplying and using\nenergy in an environmentally responsible manner.\n\n<a id='a002fea2-2693-4e88-9856-83552ba1fe91'></a>\n\n6\n\n<a id='f6f72655-faff-45ea-a8d5-70cd9b18ddef'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/pgfl0228",

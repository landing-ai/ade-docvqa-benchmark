Formation during curing occurs through nitrosation. Occurrence in smoke results from pyrosynthesis or by direct transfer from tobacco. NNK is found in both mainstream smoke and in sidestream smoke. NNK is carcinogenic in laboratory animals. Hoffmann et al, 1981, (Reference 1) states NNK is a strong carcinogen which induces lung adenomas in mice, carcinomas in the nasal cavity, liver and lung of rats, tracheal tumors and carcinomas of the nasal cavity and lung of hamsters. Hoffmann et al, 1986, (Reference 2) depict NNK as one of the most powerful carcinogens in tobacco smoke. They say NNK induces benign and malignant tumors in laboratory animals in both the upper respiratory tract and in the lung. According to Hoffman et al, 1985, (Reference 3) 1 mg of NNK will induce lung tumors in hamsters.\n\n<a id='035899eb-37b4-4591-b1ec-1518bb72c268'></a>\n\nBurley tobacco contains higher levels of NNK and other tobacco-specific nitrosamines than do other types of tobaccos. Air-curing under hot, humid conditions increases the amounts found (Reference 4). Andersen et al, 1985, (Reference 5) measured levels of NNK. They used Ky 14 burley grown under different shade conditions and air-cured. They also used air-cured and homogenized-leaf-cured burley tobaccos from conventionally grown tobaccos with different alkaloid genotypes. They found NNK contents ranged from 0.2\u00b5g/g - 0.5\u00b5g/g in air-cured Ky 14 tobacco lamina from leaves grown under 0 - 65% shade (100, 65, 35% of natural light). The highest NNK concentrations were from 45% shade-grown lamina from the lower leaf positions on stalks according to this study. Andersen et al concluded that NNK contents increased in lamina from successively lower leaf positions of non-shade-grown and 45% shade-grown plants. They believe this is due to the leaves of the lower stalk positions being more mature than the leaves from the upper stalk positions. Andersen et al concluded that levels of NNK increased during each stage of homogenized-leaf-curing in the tested tobacco genotypes. Their study indicated that NNK accumulated to a larger extent than NNN in the homogenized-leaf-cured high-alkaloid burley tobacco. NNK was significantly lower in the low-alkaloid line than in the high-alkaloid line for both the air-cured and the homogenized-leaf-cured tobaccos at each period of measurement throughout storage according to this study. MacKown et al, 1984, (Reference 6) postulate that fertilization with nitrogen plays a role in the amounts of tobacco-specific nitrosamines found in tobacco. Burley tobacco generally receives more nitrogen fertilizer than does flue-cured tobacco. NNK levels were measured in several burley genotypes in 1981 when there was no nitrogen fertilization. The levels ranged from 0.05 - 0.23 ppm. In 1982, with nitrogen fertilizer applied, the levels ranged from 0.08 - 0.71 ppm.

Formation during curing occurs through nitrosation. Occurrence in smoke results from pyrosynthesis or by direct transfer from tobacco. NNK is found in both mainstream smoke and in sidestream smoke. NNK is carcinogenic in laboratory animals. Hoffmann et al, 1981, (Reference 1) states NNK is a strong carcinogen which induces lung adenomas in mice, carcinomas in the nasal cavity, liver and lung of rats, tracheal tumors and carcinomas of the nasal cavity and lung of hamsters. Hoffmann et al, 1986, (Reference 2) depict NNK as one of the most powerful carcinogens in tobacco smoke. They say NNK induces benign and malignant tumors in laboratory animals in both the upper respiratory tract and in the lung. According to Hoffman et al, 1985, (Reference 3) 1 mg of NNK will induce lung tumors in hamsters.\n\n<a id='035899eb-37b4-4591-b1ec-1518bb72c268'></a>\n\nBurley tobacco contains higher levels of NNK and other tobacco-specific nitrosamines than do other types of tobaccos. Air-curing under hot, humid conditions increases the amounts found (Reference 4). Andersen et al, 1985, (Reference 5) measured levels of NNK. They used Ky 14 burley grown under different shade conditions and air-cured. They also used air-cured and homogenized-leaf-cured burley tobaccos from conventionally grown tobaccos with different alkaloid genotypes. They found NNK contents ranged from 0.2\u00b5g/g - 0.5\u00b5g/g in air-cured Ky 14 tobacco lamina from leaves grown under 0 - 65% shade (100, 65, 35% of natural light). The highest NNK concentrations were from 45% shade-grown lamina from the lower leaf positions on stalks according to this study. Andersen et al concluded that NNK contents increased in lamina from successively lower leaf positions of non-shade-grown and 45% shade-grown plants. They believe this is due to the leaves of the lower stalk positions being more mature than the leaves from the upper stalk positions. Andersen et al concluded that levels of NNK increased during each stage of homogenized-leaf-curing in the tested tobacco genotypes. Their study indicated that NNK accumulated to a larger extent than NNN in the homogenized-leaf-cured high-alkaloid burley tobacco. NNK was significantly lower in the low-alkaloid line than in the high-alkaloid line for both the air-cured and the homogenized-leaf-cured tobaccos at each period of measurement throughout storage according to this study. MacKown et al, 1984, (Reference 6) postulate that fertilization with nitrogen plays a role in the amounts of tobacco-specific nitrosamines found in tobacco. Burley tobacco generally receives more nitrogen fertilizer than does flue-cured tobacco. NNK levels were measured in several burley genotypes in 1981 when there was no nitrogen fertilization. The levels ranged from 0.05 - 0.23 ppm. In 1982, with nitrogen fertilizer applied, the levels ranged from 0.08 - 0.71 ppm.

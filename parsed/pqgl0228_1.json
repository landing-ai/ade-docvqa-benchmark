It proposes a pipeline to carry Alaskan gas from Prudhoe Bay across the Yukon Territory and western Canada to the United States. At some unknown future date, it would be expanded to include a spur line from the Mackenzie Delta along the Dempster highway to carry Canadian gas to Canadian markets. The current proposal before the NEB does not include an application to build this spur.\n\n<a id='a7733747-6e1e-45ec-8935-558fafcd371b'></a>\n\nTiming\n\nConstruction of the Alcan line would start as soon as approvals are received and would probably be completed within the same time frame as the Canadian Arctic Gas proposal.\n\n<a id='491ec100-1ca3-4671-9c19-7dfc335e6589'></a>\n\nIf, at a future date, the decision is made that the Alcan line should\ntransport Canadian gas also, a substantial section of the original line\nwould have to be expanded. Financial consultants believe that those\nfinancing the Alcan line would want to see the system built and operating\nbefore they would consider expanding it to transport Canada's gas.\nBecause of this, it is possible construction of the Dempster spur would\nnot start until at least two years after the Alcan line begins operation.\nThis would mean that Mackenzie Delta gas would not start flowing south\nuntil 1987 or 1988, five or six years later than the start-up date\nproposed in the Canadian Arctic Gas timetable.\n\n<a id='f33580b7-69ce-4195-955d-7d2d9b544e0e'></a>\n\nConstruction and Operating Costs\n\nThe Alcan/Dempster route would be about 835 miles longer than the proposed Arctic Gas route. At initial capacities the Alcan/Dempster line would cost nearly $2.5 billion more to build than the Arctic Gas line.\n\n<a id='1d32c4d1-c580-443b-b3b6-134dac13fe23'></a>\n\nThe Dempster spur line to the Mackenzie Delta would carry only Canadian gas. Because of this and other factors such as overall distance, the costs of transporting Delta gas would be higher than transmission by the Arctic Gas line by something like 40 cents a thousand cubic feet. At 1\u00bc billion cubic feet of Delta gas a day, this is an additional cost of nearly $200 million a year.\n\n<a id='2f1fa848-f1d1-40a0-9a32-601918c9c8ef'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/pqgl0228",

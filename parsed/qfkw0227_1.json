To establish such a data base, it was necessary to integrate data processing with the processing of the review and award operations of the National Institutes of Health. In this manner, IMPAC builds the required data base while it provides each initial review group and advisory council with the necessary documents and reports required prior to and subsequent to each step in the application review process. Similarly, the award notice as well as peripheral supporting documents are prepared by IMPAC and furnished to the Institutes for issuance. The continuing interaction which occurs between IMPAC and the review groups and Institutes and Divisions during the review and award process insures the development of a complete, accurate, and timely data base.\n\n<a id='1e9d22bd-412a-43d4-b0db-abf4e9d5ea05'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/qfkw0227",

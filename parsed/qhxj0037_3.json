Nicotine in gas and particulate phases, solanesol, aldehydes, 3-ethenylpyridine, CO, CO\u2082, O\u2082, RSP, temperature and pressure were measured in the smoking section and at three locations in the non-smoking section with the PASS samplers. Nicotine and cotinine were measured in the total urine samples of the passengers who operated the samplers for the time period extending 24 hours before the flight to 48 hours after the flight. Atmospheric samples were also collected to determine the personnel's exposure to nicotine during the same time period. This study concluded that the rate of penetration of ETS species from smoking to non-smoking sections followed first order mechanism, cotinine in urine was highly correlated with nicotine, nicotine disappeared more rapidly in the cabin air than RSP, CO and NO, probably due to the adsorption by the fabrics, and for the passengers in the non-smoking section, more exposure to nicotine occurred in the airport than in the aircraft cabin.\n\n<a id='3ff32725-acdc-4099-9e39-9d92647472a7'></a>\n\nA separate study concerning nicotine in ETS by P. R. Nelson (R. J. Reynolds Tobacco) showed a different decay phenomenon. With a controlled environmental chamber, 1R4F Kentucky reference cigarettes, and real-time and discreet analyses, the ratios between the concentrations of nicotine and other selected ETS constituents such as CO, CO\u2082, NO\u2082, pyridine, solanesol, RSP and total hydrocarbons were calculated up to six hours following the smoking. The wide variation of the ratios was caused by the decay of nicotine at a different rate than other ETS components. The data also indicated that nicotine tended to linger in the environment longer than other ETS constituents due to the adsorption and re-evaporation involving the chamber wall. Exposure to ETS solely based on nicotine concentration may be overestimated and exposure to nicotine while other ETS constituents are absent is possible.\n\n<a id='75da89ae-71c8-4f5c-88bc-a5926cfee617'></a>\n\nOther talks in this session included a pilot field study from Battelle Institute by measuring PAH's associated with smoking, heating and cooking systems in residential air; a comparative study of PASS and personal sampling methods for nicotine in ETS by W.

The Battelle data came from a very small sample size (eight homes) and appeared to be biased, in my opinion, to single out cigarette smoke. The Lorillard study, conducted in 20 restaurants, found that PASS cases provided nicotine concentration consistently and significantly higher (p<0.02) than that from the personal sampler.

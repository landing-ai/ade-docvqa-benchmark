Table 3 shows the wide variety and rather common use of some non-vegetarian foods in the diets of these subjects. Eggs were more frequently eaten as such than used as an ingredient, while milk was used in coffee and chowder but only by one individual as a beverage. A wide variety of cheese and fish was reported. Chicken was recorded by one family and turkey, bacon, and ham by two individuals. A few subjects ate such commercial items as bagels, ice cream, and yogurt. All ate a large and varied amount of vegetables and used the tops of carrots, cauliflower, turnips, and beets, further indicating that the diet was not an extreme form, i.e., composed primarily of grains. These rather large quantities of vegetables were, of course, good sources of carotene and ascorbic acid.\n\n<a id='694bcffc-d7a6-4a2e-9c53-33bb3c6a31e3'></a>\n\nAs expected, grains appeared frequently and formed the base of the diet. Those commonly used were brown rice, buckwheat, and millet.

To express the nutrient intake as percentage\nof the Recommended Dietary Allowances (20), the\nadults were classified, by sex, into two age-groups\n(nineteen to twenty-two and twenty-three to fifty\nyears) as were the children (one to three years and\nfour to six), whose dietary intakes were recorded by\ntheir mothers.\n\n<a id='29b8958d-a40d-4b3f-9c48-6b73f4533494'></a>\n\nResults and discussion\nSixty ten-day dietary records were obtained from\nfifty adults and ten children. The average age, height,\nweight, triceps skinfold thickness, arm circumference,\nand fat area of the adults (twenty-one women and\ntwenty-nine men) are presented in Table 1. Accord-\ning to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's ta-\nble (21), none of the adults was below his/her desir-\nable weight, although all were at the low limit of the\nnormal range. Average triceps skinfold thicknesses\nof the men and women were 50 and 57 per cent, re-\nspectively, of normal values; according to figures es-\ntablished in the Ten-State Survey (23), they would\nfall in the 15th percentile; the arm circumference of\nboth the men and women would fall in the 5th percen-\ntile (22,23). The fat area for the men was half that\nof the women. Interestingly, most of the subjects re-\nported having lost weight on this diet, although no at-\ntempt was made to quantify weight loss.\n\n<a id='90b87e7a-a8b6-4c00-b089-bc1ef4f61850'></a>\n\nThe majority of the subjects lived in study houses\nor with spouses and had a relatively high level of edu-\ncation (Table 2). The average educational level was\nthat of a junior in college (fifteen years). Several\nmen were employed in a warehouse-distribution cen-\nter which specialized in natural foods, where they\nwere engaged in moderate work. The remainder of\nthe men and all of the women were in occupations in-\nvolving light activity.\n\n<a id='d5a3a1c1-49ee-42bd-b2bb-fdf65cf121ef'></a>\n\nMost of the subjects had been practicing macrobi-otics for at least a year. Natural or organic foods bought from natural food distribution centers or from farms were generally used. The subjects realized that they paid more for these foods but believed they were worth the extra cost. These were supplemented with foods from local groceries and supermarkets. The ma-jority ate at macrobiotic or health food restaurants occasionally, some as often as twice a week.\n\n<a id='4a55fa92-8ac7-4206-962e-913a34d02a3a'></a>\n\n<table id=\"0-E\">\n<tr><td id=\"0-F\">Table 2: Demographic data adult subjects</td><td id=\"0-G\">on the</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-H\">datum</td><td id=\"0-I\">number of subjects</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-J\">living condition in study house</td><td id=\"0-K\">29</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-L\">with spouse</td><td id=\"0-M\">14</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-N\">with someone</td><td id=\"0-O\">5</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-P\">alone</td><td id=\"0-Q\">2</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-R\">educational level* attended college at least 2 years</td><td id=\"0-S\">26</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-T\">bachelor's degree</td><td id=\"0-U\">11</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-V\">master's degree</td><td id=\"0-W\">3</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-X\">doctorate</td><td id=\"0-Y\">1</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-Z\">registered nurse</td><td id=\"0-10\">2</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-11\">employment women</td><td id=\"0-12\"></td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-13\">homemaker</td><td id=\"0-14\">8</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-15\">cook</td><td id=\"0-16\">7</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-17\">student</td><td id=\"0-18\">4</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-19\">clerk</td><td id=\"0-1a\">2</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-1b\">men</td><td id=\"0-1c\"></td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-1d\">warehouse distribution center</td><td id=\"0-1e\">13</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-1f\">waiter</td><td id=\"0-1g\">2</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-1h\">caretaker of study house</td><td id=\"0-1i\">3</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-1j\">clerk</td><td id=\"0-1k\">1</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-1l\">engineer</td><td id=\"0-1m\">1</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-1n\">musician</td><td id=\"0-1o\">1</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-1p\">student</td><td id=\"0-1q\">3</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-1r\">other</td><td id=\"0-1s\">5</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-1t\">macrobiotics practice</td><td id=\"0-1u\"></td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-1v\">at least one year</td><td id=\"0-1w\">41</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-1x\">at least five years</td><td id=\"0-1y\">9</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-1z\" colspan=\"2\">*Average educational level: 15 years.</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<a id='cf893ce7-9728-4a87-97bd-40d4a8fd547a'></a>\n\nAll of the adult subjects believed the diet improved their health, and 90 per cent had additional reasons for following it. Few claimed to be strict vegetarians, and the dietary records indicate that none was following high levels of the Zen macrobiotic regimen or was an extreme vegetarian.\n\n<a id='df95a110-3f8d-4450-9780-302dc437a4e0'></a>\n\nDIET CONTENT. Table 3 shows the wide variety and rather common use of some non-vegetarian foods in the diets of these subjects. Eggs were more frequently eaten as such than used as an ingredient, while milk was used in coffee and chowder but only by one individual as a beverage. A wide variety of cheese and fish was reported. Chicken was recorded by one family and turkey, bacon, and ham by two individuals. A few subjects ate such commercial items as bagels, ice cream, and yogurt. All ate a large and varied amount of vegetables and used the tops of carrots, cauliflower, turnips, and beets, further indicating that the diet was not an extreme form, i.e., composed primarily of grains. These rather large quantities of vegetables were, of course, good sources of carotene and ascorbic acid.\n\n<a id='694bcffc-d7a6-4a2e-9c53-33bb3c6a31e3'></a>\n\nAs expected, grains appeared frequently and formed the base of the diet. Those commonly used were brown rice, buckwheat, and millet. They were often eaten in combination with legumes, such as aduki or pinto beans, thus enhancing protein intake.\n\n<a id='35427133-8467-426d-b70e-7faaad41ed0b'></a>\n\n456\n\n<a id='855cc395-8144-4924-873e-f3734296d8b1'></a>\n\nResearch\n\n<a id='0f1d21b9-1769-4375-bbeb-0bb1a4f78848'></a>\n\nJournal of The American Dietetic Association\n\n<a id='424bd934-f148-4d93-b8c6-7f266b0244ed'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/qpbx0227",

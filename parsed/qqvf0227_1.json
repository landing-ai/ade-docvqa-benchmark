Round ones, square ones, fat ones and lean ones.\n\nNot only do they quench large thirsts in a fun way; they also help balance the diet. After all, healthy bodies need 5 to 6 glasses of water a day. Soft drinks contain the purest, filtered water.\n\nSo sandwich soft drinks among your sandwiches. And celebrate National Sandwich Month every month in the year.\n\nFor information on soft drinks and the balanced diet, write:\n\n<a id='7032ad33-90f4-408a-aa10-16182cc22bde'></a>\n\n<::Logo: The letters \"NSDA\" in a bold, sans-serif font, with a striped background, positioned in the top right corner of the image.::>\nNATIONAL SOFT DRINK ASSOCIATION\n1128 SIXTEENTH ST., N.

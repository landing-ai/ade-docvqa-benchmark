Long-established\nfinancial practices enabled us to minimize the adverse effects of\ndevaluation in France, revaluation in Germany, and severe\ninflation in several Latin American countries. CPC/Europe\nfurther broadened Knorr's product line and distribution in 1969,\nas demand for Knorr soups and cubes continued to rise.\nEuropean operations are expected to benefit from new product\nprograms launched over the past six years. Our experience\ndemonstrates that as the economies of countries strengthen, as\ntheir affluence grows, and as eating patterns develop higher\nsophistication, we are able to enter additional markets with such\nproven product lines as Hellmann's and Knorr. This\nstrengthened our consumer businesses in Japan, the Philip-\npines, and several Latin American countries during the year.\n\n<a id='78b302a1-c74e-4600-83e8-d6de13b6beb7'></a>\n\nCapital expenditures for 1969 were $42.8 million, which were\nbelow the 1968 figure.

In July, the company paid its 200th consecutive\nquarterly dividend.\n\n<a id='a37dbe39-e693-4412-a10b-f2f6087e4c36'></a>\n\nThis Annual Report reviews 1969 progress of Corn Industrial,\nBest Foods, CPC Development, CPC/Europe, CPC/Latin\nAmerica, and CPC/Far East. The three overseas operations\nrepresent businesses carried on by local affiliates in each area.\nThe Report also summarizes general corporate activities.\n\n<a id='fe2098d0-f684-4326-b08e-8060c92b6dc8'></a>\n\nHighlighting accomplishments last year in the United States:\nHellmann's and Best Foods mayonnaise and Skippy peanut\nbutter set record sales and profits. Several businesses of CPC\nDevelopment also achieved sales and earnings highs, with\nsignificant gains by S. B. Penick, a manufacturer of medicinal\nand industrial chemicals. Sales of Corn Industrial's line of\nspecialty products increased. But this component, which serves\nmore than 60 basic industries, experienced generally higher\noperating costs, which affected earnings. Although corn syrup\nand dextrose prices stabilized, profit margins on many\nstarch-based industrial products deteriorated. Consequently,\nour return on investment for Corn Industrial during 1969 was less\nthan goal and below the 1968 level. We have restructured our\nmarketing and sales forces to meet more specifically the needs\nof today's changing markets.\n\n<a id='a6a620d2-2566-4dd7-8256-2dd0c10d370b'></a>\n\nAbroad, we achieved record sales and profits, despite unfavor-\nable economic conditions in several countries. Long-established\nfinancial practices enabled us to minimize the adverse effects of\ndevaluation in France, revaluation in Germany, and severe\ninflation in several Latin American countries. CPC/Europe\nfurther broadened Knorr's product line and distribution in 1969,\nas demand for Knorr soups and cubes continued to rise.\nEuropean operations are expected to benefit from new product\nprograms launched over the past six years. Our experience\ndemonstrates that as the economies of countries strengthen, as\ntheir affluence grows, and as eating patterns develop higher\nsophistication, we are able to enter additional markets with such\nproven product lines as Hellmann's and Knorr. This\nstrengthened our consumer businesses in Japan, the Philip-\npines, and several Latin American countries during the year.\n\n<a id='78b302a1-c74e-4600-83e8-d6de13b6beb7'></a>\n\nCapital expenditures for 1969 were $42.8 million, which were\nbelow the 1968 figure. Capital expenditures for 1970 will be\nsomewhat higher than 1969, shared about evenly between the\nU.S. and abroad. We will be periodically reviewing these\n\n<a id='ebc25a0e-3f20-44c6-ae2e-3dd87a03d344'></a>\n\nMarch 13, 1970\n\n<a id='61e20602-4e01-417f-9210-b630c6a24733'></a>\n\nexpenditures during the year. About one-third of this total will be spent for facilities and equipment to introduce new products and develop others; another third will finance plant expansion to keep pace with customer demand for existing products; while the remainder will be used to modernize existing facilities and to replace worn equipment.\n\n<a id='931ea7c6-ee8d-4e51-9d22-b8b2440a2734'></a>\n\nOur company today markets products in 37 countries and the United States. In the 1970's we will extend distribution of selective existing products into presently established markets, as well as expand into new and untapped geographical areas; we will increase our emphasis on introducing specialty products promising more favorable return on investment; we will broaden our base through related new businesses; and we will improve our return on present product lines by reducing operating costs, where possible, or by eliminating or reducing our investment in those areas which fail to meet expectations.\n\n<a id='e2bee7d5-4bdd-41aa-a6d6-53c3ea52ae12'></a>\n\nWe are moving forward to implement this plan for growth, while\nadapting to changing business conditions and to a changing\nenvironment, which demands increasing corporate social\ninvolvement.\n\n<a id='a917d52c-fdd8-493b-9313-d22f50f123b7'></a>\n\nOf course, the ultimate success of our diverse multinational\noperations depends upon the skills, leadership, and dedication\nof our 43,600 employees.

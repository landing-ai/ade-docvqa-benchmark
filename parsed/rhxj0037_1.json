The four samples labelled Run's 515, 516, 517 and Liquid CO\u2082 were evaporated and redissolved in deutero-chloroform. Proton spectra of 515, 516, and 517, shown in Figures 1a-c, were very similar and indicated these samples to be mixtures of solanesol, probably some other isoprenoids, and aliphatic waxes (long chain hydrocarbon). Not much can be said about the aliphatic hydrocarbon region due to the overall complexity of this region. The level of solanesol in each of these samples appeared to be approximately the same. Looking closely at the region between 3.9 and 4.3 ppm, revealed the subtle differences between these three samples. If we use solanesol as a model, the methylene with an attached -OH comes in this region and therefore similar methylene adjacent to oxygen fragments would also appear in this region. Most noticeable in this region was the doublet of doublets, (dd), at 3.95 ppm (probably from one compound) which appeared strong in Run's 515 and 517, was a fourth as much in Run 516. Another set of dd at 4.3 ppm that appeared in 515 and 517 is absent (or much lesser amount) in 516. This would indicate that the presence of filler has some diminishing effect on the amounts of these compounds. This is also consistent with that \"mystery\" compound discussed at a previous meeting.\n\n<a id='0bbf1b49-5d05-436b-92cf-99adf4a85c95'></a>\n\nThe region between 4.95 and 5.5 ppm contained several resonances, besides those of solanesol, indicative of other similar type olephinic compounds. The downfield doublet of doublets at 6.4 ppm, previously thought to be typical of a terminal vinyl ether methine proton, has been assigned to neophytadiene. This resonance, as well as three doublets in the 4.95-5.5 ppm region, were identified from a spectrum of neophytadiene, Figure 2.\n\n<a id='e7510d2b-645a-47d7-bc4c-429e302f9b2b'></a>\n\nThe sample labelled Liquid CO\u2082 gave a much simpler \u00b9H spectrum, Figure 3a, in that it appeared to be predominently solanesol and aliphatic hydrocarbon. The dd at 3.95 ppm is also visible in this sample. Neophytadiene or the other olephinic compounds that were found in the three previous spectra were not present in the Liquid CO\u2082 spectrum.\n\n<a id='13ac733f-799b-45bb-a9b8-3f1d69a5f2b1'></a>\n\nFigure 3b is the \"C spectrum of the Liquid CO\u2082 extract. The three large peaks at 14, 23,\nand 32 ppm are from hexane that remains due to incomplete evaporation of all the solvent.\nThese three peaks are contained in all the carbon spectra. The \"C spectra of the samples from\nRun's 515-517 were very similar as expected from the 'H data. In Figure 4, which is from Run\n515, the aliphatic region of the spectrum contains the greatest number of resonaces originating\nfrom the long chain hydrocarbons.

This resonance, as well as three doublets in the 4.95-5.5 ppm region, were identified from a spectrum of neophytadiene, Figure 2.\n\n<a id='e7510d2b-645a-47d7-bc4c-429e302f9b2b'></a>\n\nThe sample labelled Liquid CO\u2082 gave a much simpler \u00b9H spectrum, Figure 3a, in that it appeared to be predominently solanesol and aliphatic hydrocarbon. The dd at 3.95 ppm is also visible in this sample. Neophytadiene or the other olephinic compounds that were found in the three previous spectra were not present in the Liquid CO\u2082 spectrum.\n\n<a id='13ac733f-799b-45bb-a9b8-3f1d69a5f2b1'></a>\n\nFigure 3b is the \"C spectrum of the Liquid CO\u2082 extract. The three large peaks at 14, 23,\nand 32 ppm are from hexane that remains due to incomplete evaporation of all the solvent.\nThese three peaks are contained in all the carbon spectra. The \"C spectra of the samples from\nRun's 515-517 were very similar as expected from the 'H data. In Figure 4, which is from Run\n515, the aliphatic region of the spectrum contains the greatest number of resonaces originating\nfrom the long chain hydrocarbons. The significant peaks in the olephinic region (115-140 ppm)\n\n<a id='c063193f-1883-49f2-aa1b-2e90c3a50c52'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/rhxj0037\n\n<a id='9bc86b3b-a8c5-4750-897f-872151f93bcf'></a>\n\n2022155960",

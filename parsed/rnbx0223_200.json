In 2011-12, the total energy consumed by ITC stands at 21,130 TJ which is 6.3% lower than the energy utilised during the previous year (22,554 TJ in 2010-11\"), inspite of significant growth in production volumes in almost all businesses.\n\n<a id='1b998d93-99ad-467c-9201-c169343bed02'></a>\n\nThe largest integrated\nPaperboards and Paper\nUnit at Bhadrachalam which\naccounted for 71% of the total\nenergy consumed across ITC\nin 2011-12 has achieved a\nsignificant reduction of 12%\nin energy consumed per tonne\nof product over the last year,\nwhich now stands at 33.21 GJ\nper tonne of product.\n\n<a id='75a1bc0e-a7c3-44f6-978e-4769b6182f09'></a>\n\n<::A black and white photograph shows a group of people, likely women, in a field or forest with numerous tall, slender trees in the background.

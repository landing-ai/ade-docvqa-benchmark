The twin objectives of revenue maximisation and tobacco control have been severely compromised by this lopsided tax policy on cigarettes which now contributes over 74% of tax revenue, whilst accounting for less than 15% of tobacco consumption. Further, the tax arbitrage opportunities have fuelled the rampant growth of illegal cigarettes.\n\n<a id='4ccc887c-a822-40e6-a5d5-7dfc669c96e1'></a>\n\nThe steep hike in Excise Duty rates announced in the\nUnion Budget 2012 will further exacerbate the problem\nof discriminatory and high taxation on cigarettes within\nthe tobacco industry.\n\n<a id='68120c2b-a971-469b-91ea-bdb3a9f20aae'></a>\n\nThe year under review also witnessed arbitrary and\nsteep hikes in VAT rates on cigarettes by many States.\nThis is a complete departure from the principles of\nuniform VAT rates enunciated by the Empowered\nCommittee in its White Paper on State level Value Added\nTax. Further, several States continued to levy\ndiscriminatory and higher rates of VAT on cigarettes\ncompared to other tobacco products, thereby widening\nthe tax gap amongst tobacco products. A plethora of 29\ndifferent tax rates are currently applicable on cigarettes\nacross States in India which has forced manufacturers\nto adopt State specific pricing. Not only will this result\nin unproductive costs in managing supply chain\ncomplexities but also lead to potential disputes in the\nassessment of ad-valorem taxes. The imposition of\nnon-uniform VAT rates by States also goes against the\ntenets of the draft National Competition Policy, which\nrecommends a 'single national market' in line with the\nprinciple that fragmented markets impede competition.\nIn addition, the resultant attractive tax arbitrage\nopportunity promotes illegal inter-State diversion of\nstocks by unscrupulous elements thus depriving the\nGovernment of revenue and diverting trade away from\nlegitimate distribution channels.\n\n<a id='e4d916e8-0034-42d9-a19b-4b75f8dc1f72'></a>\n\nThe findings reported in the Global Adult Tobacco Survey\n(GATS) India, 2009-10 study, conducted under the aegis\nof the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, shows that\nwhilst the consumer base of tobacco in India stands at\n34.6% of all adults, the cigarette share is only 5.7%.\nAbout 75% of Indian tobacco consumers consume non-\nsmoking tobacco products mainly in the form of oral\nchewing products which constitutes the single largest\nconsumer base for tobacco products in India. It may be\nnoted that India, with 17% of the world population,\n\n<a id='58097cf8-773f-45c1-b7e7-7b54347c50dc'></a>\n\naccounts for 89% of global tobacco consumption in smokeless form. Cigarette consumption in India, on the other hand, constitutes only 1.9% of global consumption. This pattern of tobacco consumption is contrary to global trends, including that of our neighbouring countries, where cigarettes are the dominant form of tobacco consumption.\n\n<a id='b8ee7749-3e24-45bd-a2ef-a490c0b00e3c'></a>\n\nThe domestic legal cigarette industry is faced with the growing menace of illegal cigarettes. Independent research indicates that, in India, whilst there is a fall in volumes of 'duty paid' cigarettes by 4.4% during the period 2005 to 2010, the 'duty-not-paid' volumes grew by 49.3% during the same period. India has now been recognised as one of the leading destinations for illegal cigarettes.\n\n<a id='0cbb2d2b-0244-44ed-bdc2-43f679fbcc74'></a>\n\nAttractive tax arbitrage opportunities, as a result of high\nlevel of taxes on the legal domestic cigarette industry in\nIndia, incentivises illegal flow of cigarettes into the\ncountry, especially of internationally advertised and\nknown brands.\n\n<a id='44548b00-a7ad-452c-84c6-3b33dc3d9a37'></a>\n\nAnother dangerous outcome of the increasing volume\nof illicit trade is that it encourages the entry of organised\ncriminal syndicates, which can have serious law and\norder consequences for the country. Internationally, it\nhas been reported that illegal profits from cigarette\nsmuggling have been used to fund terrorist activities.\n\n<a id='cb1f5a3a-fc48-480d-9d25-35df81943f67'></a>\n\nCoupled with our porous borders, cigarette imports under\nOpen General License (OGL) make it extremely difficult\nto monitor and regulate the inflow of illegal stocks.\nFurther, with the domestic cigarette industry being strictly\nregulated, including compulsory licensing under the\nIndustrial (Development & Regulation) Act, 1951, a liberal\nimport policy is contrary to the Government's tobacco\ncontrol policies. This is also detrimental to the interests\nof Indian tobacco farmers, as it directly impacts the\ndemand for indigenous tobacco by the domestic industry.\n\n<a id='8aa182fe-e442-4edd-ba8a-f0a6654c8341'></a>\n\nThe demographic construct of India's population calls\nfor multiple price points to meet the needs of the country's\ndiverse consumer segments. The growth of illegal\ncigarettes is also aided by the vacuum created at lower\nprice points, where legal industry has been unable to\noperate, due to a disproportionately high tax burden.\nFurther, the lacunae in the provisions of the Industrial\n(Development & Regulation) Act, 1951 encourages\n\n<a id='5bcdb0d0-a744-491f-9569-78493a7b6a48'></a>\n\nAttractive tax arbitrage opportunities, as a result of high level of taxes on the legal domestic cigarette industry in India, incentivises illegal flow of cigarettes into the country.\n\n<a id='55d8340d-e5f0-438e-a0ff-9751dce218cf'></a>\n\nITC Report and Accounts 2012\ndu/docs/mbx0223\n\n<a id='d390c7a1-ca68-423e-8381-5046c7da6aa5'></a>\n\nITC Report and Accounts 2012\ndu/docs/mbx0223\n\n<a id='d75fa751-0ac3-4a7c-90ed-b218fe133cde'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.e\n\n<a id='bf84283b-b6da-434f-99f2-856373bc94c3'></a>\n\n<::logo: [Unknown]\n39\nWhite numbers \"39\" are displayed on a dark, textured square background.::>",

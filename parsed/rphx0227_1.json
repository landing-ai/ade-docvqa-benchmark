In vitro protein synthesis by the cbr was found to be 2-fold greater than the cbl or opl while no significant difference was observed between the cbl or opl. When the PMS of the three regions of the brain was fractionated by centrifugation into microsomes and post-microsomal supernatant (cell sap), the higher protein synthetic activity of the cbr was found to be due to both microsomal and cell sap factors. Centrifugation of the PMS of the cbr, cbl, or opl through sucrose gradients showed that ribosome aggregation to mRNA was greatest for the cbr. The activity of brain ribosomes stripped of endogenous mRNA was tested in a system containing polyuridylic acid (150 \u00b5g/ml) and \u00b9\u2074C-phenylalanine. The incorporation of \u00b9\u2074C-phenylalanine into acid insoluble material by the ribosomes from the cbr was consistently 10-15% greater than either the cbl or opl. The three regions of the brain also exhibited different sensitivities to aurintricarboxylic acid, an inhibitor of in vitro initiation of protein synthesis. At a concentration of 50 \u00b5M, in vitro protein synthesis by the PMS from the cbr and opl was inhibited 44% and 22% respectively while no inhibition was observed in the PMS from the cbl.\n(Supported by Nutrition Foundation Grant # 471)",

In vitro protein synthesis by the cbr was found to be 2-fold greater than the cbl or opl while no significant difference was observed between the cbl or opl. When the PMS of the three regions of the brain was fractionated by centrifugation into microsomes and post-microsomal supernatant (cell sap), the higher protein synthetic activity of the cbr was found to be due to both microsomal and cell sap factors. Centrifugation of the PMS of the cbr, cbl, or opl through sucrose gradients showed that ribosome aggregation to mRNA was greatest for the cbr. The activity of brain ribosomes stripped of endogenous mRNA was tested in a system containing polyuridylic acid (150 \u00b5g/ml) and \u00b9\u2074C-phenylalanine. The incorporation of \u00b9\u2074C-phenylalanine into acid insoluble material by the ribosomes from the cbr was consistently 10-15% greater than either the cbl or opl. The three regions of the brain also exhibited different sensitivities to aurintricarboxylic acid, an inhibitor of in vitro initiation of protein synthesis. At a concentration of 50 \u00b5M, in vitro protein synthesis by the PMS from the cbr and opl was inhibited 44% and 22% respectively while no inhibition was observed in the PMS from the cbl.\n(Supported by Nutrition Foundation Grant # 471)",

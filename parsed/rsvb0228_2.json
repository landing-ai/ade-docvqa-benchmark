Information About Appointments\n\n_Appointments to positions in the competitive service:_ The Civil Service Act places most positions in the \"competitive service.\" The Civil Service Commission sets qualification requirements and controls recruitment for such positions. As a general rule, persons selected from civil service registers to fill continuing jobs in the competitive service are given career-conditional appointments. Such appointments are secured through direct competition with other members of the general public seeking similar work in Government agencies, and permit qualified employees to be assigned without further competitive examination to other jobs in the competitive service. Career-conditional appointments become career appointments upon completion of 3 years of substantially continuous creditable service.\n\n<a id='6bee4f42-72a5-4fce-9419-9f7228a1994d'></a>\n\nThe first year following a nontemporary competitive appointment gen-erally is a probationary period, during which period an appointee must demonstrate his full competence and fitness for Federal employment Reinstatements are also subject to a probationary period unless one was previously completed. Transfers, promotions, changes to lower grade, and reassignments during a probationary period are subject to completion of probation.\n\n<a id='c7cc2aa3-176c-4801-a807-45a13185961e'></a>\n\nTemporary appointments do not confer a civil service status and do not lead to a career or career-conditional appointment without some further examination or qualification. Limited temporary appointments are made when there is no continuing need for a person's service, regardless of the manner in which he qualified for appointment; acceptance of such appointment will not remove a person's name from a civil service register on which he may later be reached for career-conditional appointment.\n\n<a id='af0ba18f-0162-40d6-8169-6419ec713d7d'></a>\n\nAppointments to positions in the excepted service: Excepted\nappointments are made to positions which are excepted from the com-\npetirive service by law or other special authority. Generally the em-\nploying agency sets qualification requirements and conducts recruitment\n\n<a id='9ba60ae8-e3a9-469f-a6fd-1ac907f9b18c'></a>\n\nfor such positions. Such appointments do not confer a competitive civil service status or eligibility for movement to jobs in the competitive service; they may be made without restrictions on tenure, with a conditional or indefinite limitation, or with a definite time limitation. A trial period may be required at the discretion of the employing office.\n\n<a id='bd2f5fe0-e4f4-4127-8243-fd9585c65cf4'></a>\n\nIII. Information About Tenure Groups\n\nEmployees are ranked in tenure groups according to the nature of their appointment; those with unrestricted tenure are placed in Group I, those serving under conditional appointments which automatically lead to full tenure after a prescribed time and without further qualification are placed in Group II, and those serving under temporary or indefinite appointments not limited to an exact time or date are placed in Group III. Within each tenure group, ranking is determined by veteran preference, performance rating, and total Federal service. If it should become necessary to reduce force employees are selected for separation or change to lower grade according to this general ranking. Employees serving under competitive appointments and those serving under excepted appointments are ranked separately for reduction in force purposes.\n\n<a id='3d04de38-61e1-4d68-af60-f9655d0093b4'></a>\n\nIV. Information About Your Status After Separation\n\nIf you are separated or placed in a nonpay status for an extended period, your employing agency will furnish you with Standard Form 8 explaining your rights for unemployment insurance benefits. If you were covered by the civil service retirement system or Federal employees group life insurance, you have previously been furnished certificates describing these programs; you can refer to such certificates for information regarding your rights and possible benefits after separation.\n\n<a id='5d0eaca9-38e7-41c2-9aee-ddfa836f72cc'></a>\n\nIf you are separated from a career or career-conditional appointment,\nyou may have reinstatement eligibility and can apply directly to any\nFederal activity and may be employed without further competitive ex\namination; if you are a nonveteran and you are separated from a\ncareer-conditional appointment your eligibility for reinstatement is gen-\nerally limited to 3 years from the date of separation. If you are sepa-\nrated from a temporary or excepted appointment, you have no rein-\nstatement privileges based upon such service.\n\n<a id='1ca64980-28a5-4b90-815b-e929e4a7506a'></a>\n\nYou will be given any lump sum payment that may be due you for an-nual leave at the time of separation. Refund of an appropriate portion of this payment will be required if you are reemployed in a Federal agency in a position under the same leave system during the period covered by such payment.\n\n<a id='db2eb6e5-5a58-4a8b-829c-f0f6ee84b4f6'></a>\n\nV. Availability of further Information\n\nConsult your supervisor if you have questions about the above state-\nments or the entries on the front of this form, or about other matters\nconcerning your employment. This is particularly important on ques-\ntions involving granting of leave, assignment of duties, and hours of\nwork which are generally under his control. If your questions are tech-\nnical, your supervisor may refer you to your personnel office which will\nhave copies of controlling civil service regulations, as well as your in-\ndividual records, and so can best explain how they apply in your case.\n\n<a id='452883a5-3203-42a9-adbe-562a47ce5c23'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/rsvb0228",

IT IS YOUR COPY OF THE OFFICIAL RECORD OF A PERSONNEL ACTION AFFECTING YOUR EMPLOYMENT.\nPROMPTLY CALL ANY ERROR TO THE ATTENTION OF YOUR SUPERVISOR OR YOUR PERSONNEL OFFICE.\n\n<a id='a799bc94-5e0d-4960-961c-0e09c4590673'></a>\n\n1. Conditions Pertinent To All Types of Personnel Action\nThe personnel action identified on the face of this form is subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations governing Federal employment and may be subject to investigation and approval by the Civil Service Commission. The action may be corrected or canceled if not in accordance with all legal requirements, or if based upon your misrepresentation or fraud.\n\n<a id='22d28d9f-2c38-4dc5-b5eb-60d87363e302'></a>\n\nIn addition, the grade of the position to which you are officially assigned may be reviewed and corrected by your agency personnel office, or by the Civil Service Commission.\n\n<a id='aa4ee306-1593-42dd-984d-56285f11be68'></a>\n\nYour performance rating upon entrance into a new position is \"satisfactory\" unless or until you are notified otherwise.\n\n<a id='27c74ab7-1c90-4fa9-96d0-46a5dff3915c'></a>\n\nItems 9 and 10 show the common types of payroll deductions; \"FEGLI\"\nfor Federal Employees Group Lite Insurance, \"CS\" for Civil Service Re-\ntirement, 'FICA\" for Social Security, and \"FS\" for Foreign Service.\nAdditional deductions may be made under the Federal Employees\nHealth Benefits program and for income taxes, bonds, and other pur-\nposes authorized by law.\n\n<a id='df2461f2-65e6-44e7-a436-1bfa82932759'></a>\n\n1. Information About Appointments\n\n_Appointments to positions in the competitive service:_ The Civil Service Act places most positions in the \"competitive service.\" The Civil Service Commission sets qualification requirements and controls recruitment for such positions. As a general rule, persons selected from civil service registers to fill continuing jobs in the competitive service are given career-conditional appointments. Such appointments are secured through direct competition with other members of the general public seeking similar work in Government agencies, and permit qualified employees to be assigned without further competitive examination to other jobs in the competitive service. Career-conditional appointments become career appointments upon completion of 3 years of substantially continuous creditable service.\n\n<a id='6bee4f42-72a5-4fce-9419-9f7228a1994d'></a>\n\nThe first year following a nontemporary competitive appointment gen-erally is a probationary period, during which period an appointee must demonstrate his full competence and fitness for Federal employment Reinstatements are also subject to a probationary period unless one was previously completed. Transfers, promotions, changes to lower grade, and reassignments during a probationary period are subject to completion of probation.\n\n<a id='c7cc2aa3-176c-4801-a807-45a13185961e'></a>\n\nTemporary appointments do not confer a civil service status and do not lead to a career or career-conditional appointment without some further examination or qualification. Limited temporary appointments are made when there is no continuing need for a person's service, regardless of the manner in which he qualified for appointment; acceptance of such appointment will not remove a person's name from a civil service register on which he may later be reached for career-conditional appointment.\n\n<a id='af0ba18f-0162-40d6-8169-6419ec713d7d'></a>\n\nAppointments to positions in the excepted service: Excepted\nappointments are made to positions which are excepted from the com-\npetirive service by law or other special authority. Generally the em-\nploying agency sets qualification requirements and conducts recruitment\n\n<a id='9ba60ae8-e3a9-469f-a6fd-1ac907f9b18c'></a>\n\nfor such positions. Such appointments do not confer a competitive civil service status or eligibility for movement to jobs in the competitive service; they may be made without restrictions on tenure, with a conditional or indefinite limitation, or with a definite time limitation. A trial period may be required at the discretion of the employing office.\n\n<a id='bd2f5fe0-e4f4-4127-8243-fd9585c65cf4'></a>\n\nIII. Information About Tenure Groups\n\nEmployees are ranked in tenure groups according to the nature of their appointment; those with unrestricted tenure are placed in Group I, those serving under conditional appointments which automatically lead to full tenure after a prescribed time and without further qualification are placed in Group II, and those serving under temporary or indefinite appointments not limited to an exact time or date are placed in Group III. Within each tenure group, ranking is determined by veteran preference, performance rating, and total Federal service. If it should become necessary to reduce force employees are selected for separation or change to lower grade according to this general ranking. Employees serving under competitive appointments and those serving under excepted appointments are ranked separately for reduction in force purposes.\n\n<a id='3d04de38-61e1-4d68-af60-f9655d0093b4'></a>\n\nIV. Information About Your Status After Separation\n\nIf you are separated or placed in a nonpay status for an extended period, your employing agency will furnish you with Standard Form 8 explaining your rights for unemployment insurance benefits. If you were covered by the civil service retirement system or Federal employees group life insurance, you have previously been furnished certificates describing these programs; you can refer to such certificates for information regarding your rights and possible benefits after separation.\n\n<a id='5d0eaca9-38e7-41c2-9aee-ddfa836f72cc'></a>\n\nIf you are separated from a career or career-conditional appointment,\nyou may have reinstatement eligibility and can apply directly to any\nFederal activity and may be employed without further competitive ex\namination; if you are a nonveteran and you are separated from a\ncareer-conditional appointment your eligibility for reinstatement is gen-\nerally limited to 3 years from the date of separation.

Refund of an appropriate portion of this payment will be required if you are reemployed in a Federal agency in a position under the same leave system during the period covered by such payment.\n\n<a id='db2eb6e5-5a58-4a8b-829c-f0f6ee84b4f6'></a>\n\nV.

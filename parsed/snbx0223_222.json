In the foreground, two individuals are actively engaged in drawing or marking on the ground. On the left, a person, possibly a woman, wearing a patterned sari, leans forward and points or draws on the ground with their right hand. On the right, a man in a light-colored shirt is also leaning forward, using his right hand to draw or mark on the ground. The other men are observing them intently.

ITC's objective is to enable these CBOs to function autonomously and play an active role in the development process. All projects are planned and implemented through CBOs. Village micro-plans are formulated by the CBOs in consultation with the NGOs with ITC providing technical and managerial inputs. All decisions regarding interventions, rules/regulations and monetary transactions are collectively decided by CBO members with NGOs and ITC's dedicated Social Investments Team available for advice on all matters. The primary reason for making the CBOs responsible for the governance of projects is to empower them to function independently and thus become active vehicles of development in the area.\n\n<a id='97e9508e-ee14-456e-9cae-33cbadc3f2d0'></a>\n\nXIII\n\n<a id='753acd30-cd77-4c91-b9d9-f0a2a972bc5d'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/snbx0223",

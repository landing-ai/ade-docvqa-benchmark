Egg yolks and organ\nmeats are very high in cholesterol.\nSuch foods are limited in low fat\ndiets. There is no cholesterol in\nfoods of plant origin, such as fruits,\nvegetables, grains, cereal and nuts,\nand generous use of these foods is\nrecommended.\n\n<a id='6f84e18f-a11a-4964-a3d4-16eba2c361e2'></a>\n\n9. **FAT CONTROLLED DIET:** A cholesterol-lowering diet, in which saturated fat is reduced, polyunsaturated fat is substituted for saturated fat, and total fat and cholesterol are moderately reduced. (It is referred to as a low fat, low cholesterol diet in the material.)\n10. **ATHEROSCLEROSIS:** (Arteriosclerosis) A disease in which there is a thickening and narrowing of the arteries (major blood vessels). The deposit of fat, cholesterol and other materials in the inner layer of the arterial wall interferes with the normal blood flow and the nourishment of the tissues. Atherosclerosis is often called \"hardening of the arteries\" (arteriosclerosis) and is the basic cause of most heart attacks and strokes.\n\n<a id='b1fbfbcf-defa-4cd0-9d2e-9584867311d8'></a>\n\n11. **CORONARY HEART DISEASE:** The most common form of adult heart disease in which the main arteries of the heart (the coronary arteries) have atherosclerotic deposits (see atherosclerosis) and the normal blood flow of the heart is impaired.\n12. **TRIGLYCERIDES:** The major fatty substance found in foods from plant and animal sources. They are also manufactured by the body from all foods and beverages and deposited as fatty tissue. Fat circulates in the body mainly as triglycerides.\n\n<a id='3cec0e63-c3b1-49bb-a5e7-88a1f5354db8'></a>\n\n<::logo: Creative Cuisine\nCreative Cuisine\nA stylized cooking pot or bowl with hearts and a spoon, rendered in an illustrative style.::>\n\n<a id='3031ddef-7766-452e-8c87-31cd90fe0f62'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/symf0227",

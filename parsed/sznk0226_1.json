ROBERT GOOD\nat the 1977 Intra-Science Symposium\n\nDr. Robert Good, Director of Research for the Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, discussed \"Medicine in China\" in a luncheon address to the 1977 Intra-Science Symposium on \"The Biochemistry of Aging.\" Having recently returned from three weeks in China as a guest of the Chinese Medical Society, Dr. Good presented an overview of a country in a very rapid state of cultural change. He pointed out that the last thirty years has been a time of very dramatic change in China, \"awful things have happened as well as good things.\" \"The university has essentially been destroyed and the graduate students are gone.\" On the other hand, he noted, \"some extraordinary things have happened in medicine.\"\n\nHe went on to say that real progress has been made in the treatment and cure of cancer in China, through their emphasis on prevention and by working with the people where they live. There are five major kinds of cancer in China, Dr. Good reported, cancer of the esophagus, the cervix, the uterus, the nasal pharynx (in the south), and the liver (in the central part).\n\nTheir big approach to esophageal cancer, Dr. Good explained, has to do with the tremendous manpower of the Chinese medical corps, numbering 4.7 million, with about 200,000 of that number being trained by what they consider western methods, even though they have reduced their medical education from six to three years. About 1.7 million of their medical corps consists of what they call \"barefoot doctors,\" who are basically apprentice trained, although they do have an orientation in the medical schools. The \"barefoot doctors\" work very closely with the people and handle between 200 and 300 cases each.\n\nDr. Good reported that the \"barefoot doctors\" using a simple balloon which they inflate and then do a cytological smear, are able to diagnose on a routine basis the precursor lesion and the early stages of carcinoma of the esophagus.\n\n<::Photograph of Dr. Robert Good speaking at a podium\n: figure::>\n\nWith an early diagnosis, the esophageal cancer can be removed, and if caught early enough they are able, they say, to cure nearly ninety percent rather than five percent using conventional methods or waiting until symptoms occur.\n\nThey relate cancer of the esophagus to several things: 1) a borderline deficiency of A and C vitamins, 2) the way they ferment their food, because they don't have refrigeration, which involves fungal infestation and very frequently the esophagus are infected by fungi, 3) there is evidence of a molybdenum deficiency in the soil in the area where there is a high frequency of esophageal cancer, and finally 4) they think nitrates are in their food and water supply in carcinogenic potential.\n\nCancer of the cervix and uterus, Dr. Good said, has been drastically reduced through control of sexual behavior, by decreasing the number of pregnancies, and by delaying pregnancies. In addition, many of the \"barefoot doctors\" specialize in women's analysis and by doing Pap smears and giving examinations, they are able to detect cancer of the cervix at a very early stage.\n\n(Continued on the next Page)",

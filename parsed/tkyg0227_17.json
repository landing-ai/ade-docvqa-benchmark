There are some fluctuations, notably a dip around 1918 and another around 1945.\n2.  **Major milk products**: This line starts at approximately 300 calories per day in 1879 and shows a general upward trend, reaching around 400 calories per day by 1955. An arrow points from this line to the label \"Fluid milk\", indicating it's a component.\n\nBelow the \"Major milk products\" line, three other lines represent specific milk products, all showing an increasing trend over the period, particularly from the 1930s onwards:\n1.  **Ice cream**: This line starts near 0 and increases to approximately 50 calories per day by 1955.\n2.  **Evap. + cond. milk**: This line starts near 0 and increases to approximately 75 calories per day by 1955.\n3.  **Cheese**: This line starts near 0 and increases to approximately 25 calories per day by 1955.\n<::\n\n*Data from Part E, Tables VI-A, VIII, IX.\n\n<a id='fdcfe555-8b7a-4e99-b9b4-270da0aa0c22'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/tkyg0227",

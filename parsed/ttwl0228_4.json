Against this backdrop of large,\npoorly understood natural variability, it is impos-\nsible for scientists to attribute the recent small\nsurface temperature increase to human causes.\n\n<a id='a519f616-fc38-481d-9d62-eea7037efa7c'></a>\n\nScience has given us enough information\nto know that climate changes may pose long-\nterm risks. Natural variability and human activity\nmay lead to climate change that could be signif-\nicant and perhaps both positive and negative.\nConsequently, people, companies and govern-\nments should take responsible actions now to\naddress the issue.\n\n<a id='d2f29155-2930-466c-880f-cc75fce9adba'></a>\n\nOne essential step is to encourage devel-\nopment of lower-emission technologies to meet\nour future needs for energy. We'll next look at\nthe promise of technology and what is being\ndone today.\n\n<a id='6ed0e13b-28c6-4efb-8dc2-bf9cf4ab1046'></a>\n\nExxonMobil\u2122\n\n<a id='cc1fa1f0-57b6-4bc6-aaad-320650102a8c'></a>\n\nwww.exxon.mobil.com\n\n<a id='b59aabe5-d753-496a-a8f5-c035e65c73b3'></a>\n\n\u00a9 2000 Exxon Mobil Corporation\n\n<a id='8d031374-0889-44e4-85fd-a1a178fa58ac'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/ttwl0228\n\n<a id='93477454-a216-4ad1-9a09-a1f697dcb168'></a>\n\nMoreover, computer models relied upon\nby climate scientists predict that lower atmos-\npheric temperatures will rise as fast as or faster\nthan temperatures at the surface. However, only\nwithin the last 20 years have reliable global\nmeasurements of temperatures in the lower at-\nmosphere been available through the use of\nsatellite technology. These measurements show\nlittle if any warming.",

The estimates made are based on the principles of prudence and reasonableness, however, actual results could differ from these estimates. Any revision to such accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in the current and future periods.\n\n<a id='2cc77395-0d0a-4b2f-bd61-e4d43fdcca36'></a>\n\n**FIXED ASSETS**\n\nTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nTangible assets are stated at historical cost, net of accumulated\ndepreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any, except\nso far as they relate to the revaluation of land and buildings.\nHistorical cost is inclusive of freight, installation cost, duties\nand taxes, interest on specific borrowings utilised for financing\nthe assets and other incidental expenses.\n\n<a id='8a54891d-bf47-4417-b68a-aedf25ad188f'></a>\n\nDepreciation is provided on plant and machinery on straight\nline basis at the rates specified in Schedule XIV of the Act.\nOn other assets, depreciation is provided on straight line basis\nat rates determined based on estimated useful life of assets.\nSuch rates adopted being higher than the Schedule XIV rates\nas given below:\n\n<a id='715d55a2-a1d1-4851-9772-7588732997ba'></a>\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Rate of Depreciation %</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Buildings Freehold</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Leasehold Property</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and Fixtures</td><td>15 - 25</td></tr><tr><td>Office Equipment</td><td>15 - 25</td></tr><tr><td>Motor Vehicles etc.</td><td>25</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<a id='ce21f4ec-2e5f-4dd2-9a46-71f89dd9e024'></a>\n\nAccelerated depreciation is provided based on technical\nevaluation of estimated useful life of an asset.

Computer software (including license fees and cost of implementation/system integration services) is capitalised where it is expected to provide future enduring economic benefits. Cost of upgradation/enhancements is charged off as revenue expenditure unless they bring similar significant additional benefits. Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is determined based on the period of the underlying contract and the period of time the intangible asset is expected to be used i.e.\n\n<a id='8b145957-5228-4afa-89d7-753f6eec7ede'></a>\n\nRights on time share - over 20 years\nComputer software - over 4 years\n\n<a id='e9c3431e-c3e0-418a-a6c0-47b20f0251ff'></a>\n\nIMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS\nAll the fixed assets are assessed for any indication of\nimpairment, at the end of each financial year. On such\nindication, the impairment loss, being the excess of carrying\nvalue over the recoverable value of the assets, is charged to\nthe statement of profit and loss in the respective financial\nyears. The impairment loss recognised in the prior years is\nreversed in cases where the recoverable value exceeds the\ncarrying value, upon re-assessment in the subsequent years.\n\n<a id='a7ad0091-485d-49f3-a436-34e1a0e756c3'></a>\n\n## INVESTMENTS\n\nLong term investments are valued at cost net of provision, for permanent diminution, if any.

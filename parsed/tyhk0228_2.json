This figure will in-\ncrease, possibly doubling by 1996,\nif CFC-12 costs continue their\npresent trends.\n\n<a id='6ef291c7-656b-4450-b63c-eec9fed40c72'></a>\n\nRetrofitting vehicle air conditioners to use refrigerants other than CFCs is possible, but also expensive. Changing a CFC-using air-conditioner to use HFC-134a (thus far the leading CFC substitute) requires the replacement of several components, as well as a thorough flushing of the system to remove all traces of CFC-12 and mineral oil. The average cost of a retrofit is over $400, and there are unanswered questions about their reliability and performance. It is unlikely that many consumers will choose the retrofit option, unless CFC-12 becomes prohibitively expensive or totally unavailable.\n\n<a id='8a0cc843-1e9c-46c6-b8c9-e817f02a37d2'></a>\n\nThe costs for existing vehicles\nwill be obvious to most consum-\ners. The costs for new vehicles will be\nmuch less so. New car and truck air-\nconditioners are now designed to use\nHFC-134a. Introduced in a few models in\n1992 and 1993, HFC-134a air-condition-\ners will predominate in 1994 models. The\nauto industry has spent several hundred\nmillion dollars to redesign vehicle air-\nconditioning systems and retool assem-\nbly lines to accommodate the changes.\nSome also question the long-term reli-\nability of HFC-134a air conditioners.\n\n<a id='3aa37a5a-b76e-4bac-b520-8c10e4e05384'></a>\n\nEventually, these costs will be passed on to consumers in one form or another.\nOf course the phaseout will impact consumers in other ways as well \u2014 for instance, in the cost of refrigerators. There are approximately 150 million refrigerators in domestic use in the U.S. Nearly\n\n<a id='c58e490b-8c92-4971-ab75-418ca0e8d29b'></a>\n\ntoo early to determine the price of these\nnew refrigerators, at least one introduc\ntory model is priced $100 higher than a\ncomparable CFC refrigerator, most o\nwhich range from $500 to $1,500, de\npending on the brand name and features\nAssuming a $50 to $100 increase pe\n\n<a id='1de50aea-1792-4608-a578-cd6f4036e05b'></a>\n\nrefrigerator, the nearly 10 million domestic refrigerators (and stand-alone freezers) sold each year will cost an additional $0.5 to $1.0 billion. Assuming HFC-134a refrigerators predominate beginning in 1996, the cost over the next decade will be $4.0 to $8.0 billion nationwide. Further, there are doubts whether these new refrigerators will last as long as their CFC-using predecessors.\n\n<a id='40a853a1-f2ef-4a4e-84c7-8b24dce3b493'></a>\n\n2.1\n.0\n.4\n.0\n.9\n9.4\nalysis:\nal and\nwater\n\nThese costs are only the beginning. The CFC phaseout is also likely to increase energy consumption, and impose significant costs on the use of residential air conditioning, commercial refrigeration, chillers, and the like. There there is the loss of CFCs and related compounds for a myriad of other applications from agriculture and medicine to dry cleaning and fire suppression. These non-cooling costs are not included in the estimate that the phaseout could cost Americans nearly $100 billion. CFCs have improved the lives of nearly every American, and doing without them will not come cheaply.\n\n<a id='db7f3942-3f87-440f-abd6-488e98e61be3'></a>\n\n**Ben Lieberman** *is an environmental*\n*research associate at CEI.

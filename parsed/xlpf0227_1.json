I think we benefited a great deal from the experiences of that group. In that particular program, dietitians were stationed in the store to answer questions from the shoppers. They felt the response to this was good. However, their chance to evaluate it was unsuccessful. They handed a questionnaire to shoppers requesting them to return it completed within a designated period of time. Consequently, few were returned. They also prepared and distributed literature containing shopping hints for a fat-controlled diet. The store personnel prepared posters on the benefits of certain food items and hung them in strategic places in the store. Labels designating recommended low saturated fat and acceptable low saturated fat products were placed under the appropriate grouping of such foods.

A Public Health Nutritionist who had worked on development and execution of a supermarket project in Washington funded by the Regional Medical Program met with us. I think we benefited a great deal from the experiences of that group. In that particular program, dietitians were stationed in the store to answer questions from the shoppers. They felt the response to this was good. However, their chance to evaluate it was unsuccessful. They handed a questionnaire to shoppers requesting them to return it completed within a designated period of time. Consequently, few were returned. They also prepared and distributed literature containing shopping hints for a fat-controlled diet. The store personnel prepared posters on the benefits of certain food items and hung them in strategic places in the store. Labels designating recommended low saturated fat and acceptable low saturated fat products were placed under the appropriate grouping of such foods. In this case, the store was constantly changing the location of foods, thus making the labels meaningless.\n\n<a id='a8139ce4-e845-485e-b441-e0bc8351e235'></a>\n\nAfter exploring several ideas of things that could be done in a super-market setting and still avoiding the endorsement problem, we felt that one of the most effective things we could do would be to prepare a packet of materials to be sent to many of the large grocery chains for their use in various ways. The packet would consist of materials such as the following:\n\n1. The Way to a Man's Heart\n2. The Recipe Booklet\n3. Save Food Dollars and Help Your Heart\n\n<a id='5cd4241f-ec0f-4ded-9fcd-e0f3cfc5f781'></a>\n\nChairman of the Board\nRichard Dotts\n\nPresident\nElliot Rapaport, M.D.\n\n<a id='54343304-5068-48a5-9e21-449e54b8bc50'></a>\n\nPresident-Elect\nJohn T.

Information About Appointments\n\n52 Appointments to positions in the competitive service: The Civil Service Act places most positions in the \"competitive service.\" The Civil Service Commission sets qualification requirements and controls recruitment for such positions. As a general rule, persons selected from civil service registers to fill continuing jobs in the competitive service are given career-conditional appointments. Such appointments are secured through direct competition with other members of the general public seeking similar work in Government agencies, and permit qualified employees to be assigned without futher competitive examination to other jobs in the competitive service. Career-conditional appointments become career appointments upon completion of 3 years of substantially continuous creditable service.\n\n50 LO: END UNBEY\n\n<a id='1bf1db66-ea61-4a31-94a1-446b2cb43439'></a>\n\nThe first year following a nontemporary competitive appointment generally is a probationary period, during which period an appointee must demonstrate his full competence and fitness for Federal employment. Reinstatements are also subject to a probationary period unless one was previously completed. Transfers, promotions, changes to lower grade, and reassignments during a probationary period are subject to completion of probation.\n\n<a id='b2054676-5733-4b01-9e04-a82c5449d9d3'></a>\n\nTemporary appointments do not confer a civil service status and do not lead to a career or career-conditional appointment without some further examination or qualification.

Within each tenure group, ranking is determined by veteran preference, performance rating, and total Federal service.

Information About Appointments\n\n52 Appointments to positions in the competitive service: The Civil Service Act places most positions in the \"competitive service.\" The Civil Service Commission sets qualification requirements and controls recruitment for such positions. As a general rule, persons selected from civil service registers to fill continuing jobs in the competitive service are given career-conditional appointments. Such appointments are secured through direct competition with other members of the general public seeking similar work in Government agencies, and permit qualified employees to be assigned without futher competitive examination to other jobs in the competitive service. Career-conditional appointments become career appointments upon completion of 3 years of substantially continuous creditable service.\n\n50 LO: END UNBEY",

Information About Tenure Groups\n\nEmployees are ranked in tenure groups according to the nature of their appointment: those with unrestricted tenure are placed in Group I, those serving under conditional appointments which automatically lead to full tenure after a prescribed time and without further qualification are placed in Group II, and those serving under temporary or indefinite appointments not limited to an exact time or date are placed in Group III.

Information About Appointments\n\n52 Appointments to positions in the competitive service: The Civil Service Act places most positions in the \"competitive service.\" The Civil Service Commission sets qualification requirements and controls recruitment for such positions. As a general rule, persons selected from civil service registers to fill continuing jobs in the competitive service are given career-conditional appointments. Such appointments are secured through direct competition with other members of the general public seeking similar work in Government agencies, and permit qualified employees to be assigned without futher competitive examination to other jobs in the competitive service. Career-conditional appointments become career appointments upon completion of 3 years of substantially continuous creditable service.\n\n50 LO: END UNBEY\n\n<a id='1bf1db66-ea61-4a31-94a1-446b2cb43439'></a>\n\nThe first year following a nontemporary competitive appointment generally is a probationary period, during which period an appointee must demonstrate his full competence and fitness for Federal employment. Reinstatements are also subject to a probationary period unless one was previously completed. Transfers, promotions, changes to lower grade, and reassignments during a probationary period are subject to completion of probation.\n\n<a id='b2054676-5733-4b01-9e04-a82c5449d9d3'></a>\n\nTemporary appointments do not confer a civil service status and do not lead to a career or career-conditional appointment without some further examination or qualification. Limited temporary appointments are made when there is no continuing need for a person's service, regardless of the manner in which he qualified for appoint-\n\n<a id='11a62605-7486-4fe7-8517-2356754ac527'></a>\n\nment; acceptance of such appointment will not remove a person's name from a civil service register on which he may later be reached for career-conditional appointment.\n\n<a id='5e3fb182-7f5d-482e-b4c8-183bd04816d5'></a>\n\nIV' CIVIL SERVICE OR OTHER LEGAL AUTHORITY\nAppointments to positions in the excepted service.

It is a simple nutritive sweetener, chemically identical to the sweetener found commonly in fruits and honey.\n\n<a id='55b4dd42-fbd0-4fc2-b409-9d543a204d80'></a>\n\n## 2. What is the Difference Between Fructose Sweetener and Ordinary Sugar?\n\nOrdinary white refined sugar, or sucrose, is a complex sweetener derived primarily from cane and sugar beets. It breaks down into equal parts of two simple sugars, fructose and dextrose. The sweetener Shasta is now using in its line of soft drinks, High Fructose Corn Sweetener 55, breaks down into 55 per cent fructose, 42 per cent dextrose and three per cent non-sweetening compounds. Because it contains a higher percentage of fructose, fructose corn sweetener is sweeter than ordinary sugar.\n\n<a id='0870d85b-7e58-4daa-878c-087e43be19d1'></a>\n\n3. Aren't Fructose Sweetener and Corn\nSyrup the Same Thing?\n\nNo. Corn syrup is a heavy syrup with a low\ndextrose content. High Fructose Corn\nSweetener is a brand new form of superior\nsweetener that is lighter, sweeter and much better\ntasting.\n\n<a id='1612e6dd-85e9-406b-8efd-80f82917641f'></a>\n\n4. Isn't Fructose a Relatively New Form of Sweetener?\n\nFructose Sweetener 55 has become commercially available only in the past few years. However, in that time it has become an increasingly popular sweetener for processed foods such as baked goods, jams, salad dressing and the like. It is being used by such companies as Sara Lee, Del Monte and Smuckers, in a variety of their products.\n\n<a id='3006a02f-2755-46d3-8cb1-70650451e008'></a>\n\n5. Isn't Fructose a Low-Calorie\nSweetener?\n\nBecause fructose sweetener is sweeter than\nsucrose, Shasta can use less of it to obtain the\ndesired level of sweetness. However, it is not a low-\ncalorie form of sweetener, like saccharin. Because\nwe are now using less sweetener in our regular line\nof soft drinks, their calorie content has been re-\nduced some ten per cent, compared to the old for-\nmulation.\n\n<a id='418b4193-c6dd-4152-93bd-5b6a5c16ebeb'></a>\n\n## 6. Why Did Shasta Switch to Fructose?\n\nThree reasons; better taste; growing consumer concern over sugar; and economic benefits for Shasta, our customers and the country.\n\n<a id='44034752-249b-4a25-8a3c-383d65d0a7fa'></a>\n\nBecause fructose sweetener is a chemically simpler\nsweetener, it enhances the taste of our products,\nrather than masking them as ordinary sugar often\ndoes. In extensive consumer taste tests, Shasta\nCola was judged to have a lighter, less sugary and\nless syrupy taste when compared to Coca-Cola and\nPepsi-Cola.\n\n<a id='7af0ebd3-4b97-4867-9464-831b69896048'></a>\n\nConsumers are growing increasingly concerned\nabout their intake of ordinary sugar. Current sugar\nconsumption averages nearly 95 pounds per person\nand the U.S. Department of Agriculture has called\nfor a 45 per cent per person reduction in white\nrefined sugar intake. Fructose sweetener provided\nShasta the opportunity to offer those consumers an\nalternative to soft drinks sweetened with ordinary\nrefined sugar. An alternative offering fewer car-\nbohydrates and calories, and better taste.\n\n<a id='883e216f-2ba8-497d-9faf-0535419a8c75'></a>\n\nFor more information on this growing concern over\nthe consumption of ordinary refined sugar, see the\nfollowing books:\n*Sugar Blues*, by William Dufty;\n*Diet Away Your Stress, Tension and Anxiety:\nThe Fructose Diet Book*, by J. Daniel Palm, Ph.D.\n*Dr. Cooper's Fabulous Fructose Diet*, by J.T.\nCooper, M.D.;\n*Sweet and Dangerous*, by John Yudkin, M.D.\n\n<a id='93f5eacb-a92c-4b7b-b897-99c3a1a7d911'></a>\n\nA final reason for our conversion involved\neconomics. Because fructose sweetener costs less\nthan ordinary sugar, Shasta can continue to offer\nits great tasting soft drinks at prices lower than\nother national brands. In addition, fructose is\navailable at stable prices and in dependable quan-\ntities unlike refined sugar from foreign sources.\nAlso, the development of the domestic sweetener\nindustry contributes to the economic well-being of\nthe United States through the development of jobs\nand favorable contributions to the U.S. balance of\ntrade.\n\n<a id='b085bf01-5b3a-4e1c-902f-ecabc25589c0'></a>\n\n**7. Will Shasta be using Fructose in Its Diet Products?**\n\nBecause fructose is not a non-calorie sweetener, Shasta will continue to use saccharin for sweetening of its diet products. However, we are in the process of reformulating our diet line. News on that reformulation will be forthcoming this fall. It will still be a low calorie or non-calorie line.\n\n<a id='b739fc6b-4bbe-40b2-a2e0-41faa6493b89'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/ykpj0226",

Aren't Fructose Sweetener and Corn\nSyrup the Same Thing?\n\nNo. Corn syrup is a heavy syrup with a low\ndextrose content. High Fructose Corn\nSweetener is a brand new form of superior\nsweetener that is lighter, sweeter and much better\ntasting.\n\n<a id='1612e6dd-85e9-406b-8efd-80f82917641f'></a>\n\n4. Isn't Fructose a Relatively New Form of Sweetener?\n\nFructose Sweetener 55 has become commercially available only in the past few years. However, in that time it has become an increasingly popular sweetener for processed foods such as baked goods, jams, salad dressing and the like. It is being used by such companies as Sara Lee, Del Monte and Smuckers, in a variety of their products.\n\n<a id='3006a02f-2755-46d3-8cb1-70650451e008'></a>\n\n5. Isn't Fructose a Low-Calorie\nSweetener?\n\nBecause fructose sweetener is sweeter than\nsucrose, Shasta can use less of it to obtain the\ndesired level of sweetness. However, it is not a low-\ncalorie form of sweetener, like saccharin. Because\nwe are now using less sweetener in our regular line\nof soft drinks, their calorie content has been re-\nduced some ten per cent, compared to the old for-\nmulation.\n\n<a id='418b4193-c6dd-4152-93bd-5b6a5c16ebeb'></a>\n\n## 6. Why Did Shasta Switch to Fructose?\n\nThree reasons; better taste; growing consumer concern over sugar; and economic benefits for Shasta, our customers and the country.\n\n<a id='44034752-249b-4a25-8a3c-383d65d0a7fa'></a>\n\nBecause fructose sweetener is a chemically simpler\nsweetener, it enhances the taste of our products,\nrather than masking them as ordinary sugar often\ndoes. In extensive consumer taste tests, Shasta\nCola was judged to have a lighter, less sugary and\nless syrupy taste when compared to Coca-Cola and\nPepsi-Cola.\n\n<a id='7af0ebd3-4b97-4867-9464-831b69896048'></a>\n\nConsumers are growing increasingly concerned\nabout their intake of ordinary sugar. Current sugar\nconsumption averages nearly 95 pounds per person\nand the U.S. Department of Agriculture has called\nfor a 45 per cent per person reduction in white\nrefined sugar intake. Fructose sweetener provided\nShasta the opportunity to offer those consumers an\nalternative to soft drinks sweetened with ordinary\nrefined sugar. An alternative offering fewer car-\nbohydrates and calories, and better taste.\n\n<a id='883e216f-2ba8-497d-9faf-0535419a8c75'></a>\n\nFor more information on this growing concern over\nthe consumption of ordinary refined sugar, see the\nfollowing books:\n*Sugar Blues*, by William Dufty;\n*Diet Away Your Stress, Tension and Anxiety:\nThe Fructose Diet Book*, by J. Daniel Palm, Ph.D.\n*Dr. Cooper's Fabulous Fructose Diet*, by J.T.\nCooper, M.D.;\n*Sweet and Dangerous*, by John Yudkin, M.D.\n\n<a id='93f5eacb-a92c-4b7b-b897-99c3a1a7d911'></a>\n\nA final reason for our conversion involved\neconomics. Because fructose sweetener costs less\nthan ordinary sugar, Shasta can continue to offer\nits great tasting soft drinks at prices lower than\nother national brands. In addition, fructose is\navailable at stable prices and in dependable quan-\ntities unlike refined sugar from foreign sources.\nAlso, the development of the domestic sweetener\nindustry contributes to the economic well-being of\nthe United States through the development of jobs\nand favorable contributions to the U.S. balance of\ntrade.\n\n<a id='b085bf01-5b3a-4e1c-902f-ecabc25589c0'></a>\n\n**7. Will Shasta be using Fructose in Its Diet Products?**\n\nBecause fructose is not a non-calorie sweetener, Shasta will continue to use saccharin for sweetening of its diet products. However, we are in the process of reformulating our diet line. News on that reformulation will be forthcoming this fall. It will still be a low calorie or non-calorie line.\n\n<a id='b739fc6b-4bbe-40b2-a2e0-41faa6493b89'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/ykpj0226",

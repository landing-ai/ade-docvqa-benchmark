The remuneration policy,\ntherefore, is market-led and takes into account the\ncompetitive circumstance of each business so as to\nattract and retain quality talent and leverage\nperformance significantly.\n\n<a id='13f501f1-7680-4659-a48e-b1c139c3e22a'></a>\n\n# Remuneration of Directors\n\nRemuneration of Executive Directors is determined by the Compensation Committee comprising only Non-Executive Directors. The recommendations of the Compensation Committee are considered and approved by the Board subject to the approval of the Shareholders. The Chairman and Executive Directors are entitled to Performance Bonus for each financial year up to a maximum of 200% and 150% of their consolidated salary, respectively, as approved by the Shareholders, and as may be determined by the Board on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee.\n\n<a id='d4373628-a43e-476e-b4a9-c4e50a052dc7'></a>\n\nNon-Executive Directors are entitled to remuneration by way of commission for each financial year, up to a maximum of Rs. 6,00,000/- individually, as approved by the Shareholders. Non-Executive Directors' commission is determined by the Board based, inter alia, on the Company's performance and regulatory provisions. Such commission is payable on a uniform basis to reinforce the principle of collective responsibility.\nNon-Executive Directors are also entitled to sitting fees for attending meetings of the Board and Committees thereof, the limits for which have been approved by the Shareholders. The sitting fees, as determined by the Board, are presently Rs. 20,000/- for attending each meeting of the Board, Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominations Committee and Sustainability Committee and Rs. 5,000/- for each meeting of the Investor Services Committee.\nNon-Executive Directors are also entitled to coverage under Personal Accident Insurance.\n\n<a id='a4f3dc66-a8f3-4735-9712-5950295cc594'></a>\n\nDetails of Remuneration paid to the Directors during\nthe financial year ended 31st March, 2009\n(Rs. in Lakhs)\n<table id=\"0-1\">\n<tr><td id=\"0-2\">Director</td><td id=\"0-3\">Consolidated Salary</td><td id=\"0-4\">Perquisites and other Benefits</td><td id=\"0-5\">Performance Bonus / Commission</td><td id=\"0-6\">Sitting Fees</td><td id=\"0-7\">Total</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"0-8\">Y.

This payment reduction would be coupled with a reduction of 40 cents per hundredweight in the excise tax on sugar. The tax reduction to be passed back to the grower to compensate for the reduced Government payment. This proposal would protect the income of sugar beet and sugarcane growers, protect domestic sugar supplies, and maintain the relative economic positions of the various segments of the domestic industry and between domestic and foreign producers, and would not affect the price of sugar to consumers.\n\n<a id='e40d7fa5-3a05-45cf-afed-d973cd4ce383'></a>\n\n12 - Miscellaneous Technical Recommendations\n\nThese include clarification of qualification for abandonment and deficiency payments; preservation of acreage history for 3 years in areas where beet sugar factories close and clarification of personal history in instances where an operator dies or is incapacitated.\n\n<a id='fda5c6e5-6292-4247-acae-a90ce0dc248a'></a>\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/yqxv0228",

Against a targeted growth of 6.5%, the country registered a GDP growth of only 5.4%, though in comparison with other economies it was reasonably satisfactory. The events of terrorist attacks in the USA and India on September 11 and December 13, 2001 respectively, impacted the global as well as Indian economy to slide down considerably. The tension on the Indian border resulted in restrictions on travel being imposed by most developed economies and that worsened the situation for the Indian economy which is still continuing to suffer from its effects. On top of that, currently the country is facing one of the worst drought situations in the last decade. The comfortable level of stocks in our granaries will, however, safeguard the country from any shortages on the food front. The year 2001-02 another in succession, witnessed a general slow down in the economy and fall in consumer spending. A large number of popular brands in the fast moving consumer goods category lost their respective market shares.\n\n<a id='06c5dd4e-2b17-48e0-8dbf-947954d3ca62'></a>\n\nHaving embarked on economic reforms and globalisation of the Indian economy for more than a decade now, investments in infrastructure as well as reforms in the agriculture sector continue to be delayed and highly deficient. Inaction on the part of the Government in accelerating the process of the reforms has started affecting growth in both manufacturing as well as agriculture sectors. The lack of long term perspective and stable and transparent policies of the Government has also resulted in both Indian as well as overseas investors shying away. This has also resulted in stagnating average per capita income of the Indian people. We have, however, been able to contain inflation. Ours is primarily an agrarian economy. We need to accelerate the process of agricultural reforms and investments in the rural infrastructure. We also have to adequately support immediately all the agro based industries on a continuing basis.\n\n<a id='b908619a-4ad3-4bc4-919a-5b0184901e66'></a>\n\n<::Net Worth* (Rs in lacs) bar chart\n\n| Year      | Net Worth (Rs in lacs) |\n| :-------- | :--------------------- |\n| 1997-98   | 12785                  |\n| 1998-99   | 16003                  |\n| 1999-2000 | 18538                  |\n| 2000-2001 | 21361                  |\n| 2001-2002 | 23934                  |\n\n* Excluding Revaluation Reserve\n: chart::>\n\n<a id='a1464a3b-e005-43e8-9480-2f99ca006d73'></a>\n\n**CIGARETTE INDUSTRY IN INDIA AND ITS POTENTIAL**\nThe domestic cigarette industry witnessed one of the sharpest declines in the sales volume in the last year when it lost more than 12% of its size as a result of steep hike in the rate of excise duty, as much as 15% across all segments. In addition, certain State Governments increased local levies such as luxury tax, entry tax and octroi tax on cigarettes. As a result, the industry was left with no choice but to raise prices of most of their brands.\n\n<a id='3f409dd1-11e8-48b2-8538-f9570bc8ffd6'></a>\n\nThe sharp increase in cigarette prices triggered an unprecedented supply of cheap smuggled cigarettes in abundance from neighboring countries. Most of them were in king size filter format selling in the market for Rs. 5 to Rs. 10 for a packet of 10 cigarettes while domestic excise duty alone works out to Rs. 14.50 for a pack of 10 sticks. Since the smuggled cigarettes offer very high margin for traders, there is a natural inducement for them to push these products. Your company has taken a number of steps on its own as well as along with other companies and enforcement agencies to curb the menace of smuggled cigarettes.\n\n<a id='14cc9d06-5eed-457f-8a9a-cb7e540d381d'></a>\n\nIndia is the second largest producer of tobacco, yet our share in the international trade continues to be less than 1%. A pragmatic and sensible approach towards tobacco will not only help the country to accelerate its export earnings but can also help raise revenue and earnings of millions of farmers.\n\n<a id='52782455-47e2-473e-a519-e52a36adfeb6'></a>\n\nCigarettes is the most preferred form of tobacco consumption all over the World except in India. India is the third largest tobacco consuming country. Yet the share of cigarettes in the total consumption has been declining year after year and has gone down to a mere 16% as against an average of 90% in the rest of the World. The prohibitive and excessive taxation on cigarettes is compelling the consumer to downgrade to other cheaper and inferior tobacco products. This is also discouraging the farmers of flue cured tobacco from making any investment in improving productivity and technological development. It may be worthwhile to note here that the per hectare earnings of farmers from flue cured tobacco is almost twice that of what he can earn by growing other types of tobaccos. This indifferent and impractical approach of the Government has also affected the growth and earnings of the domestic cigarette industry. The lack of clarity and absence of any durable policy of the Government for this sector has also discouraged the Indian industry from making any investments in developing the export market, which you will appreciate is highly competitive and dominated by major global corporations. With the capacity and skill available within the industry, we are confident that Indian companies can gain a respectable share in international trade and enhance the country's export earnings manifold with the desired support from the Government. Brazil and China are classic examples as they have achieved a significant presence in the global market with their consistent efforts in that direction. The Government must focus its attention urgently to the need of the industry by providing an environment in which it can adequately grow and face global competition within and outside the country. There is an imminent need to rationalize the tax structure whereby the wide differential in the taxation of various tobacco products inter-se is gradually reduced and the States are discouraged from levying tax on cigarettes indiscriminately and differentially.

Against a targeted growth of 6.5%, the country registered a GDP growth of only 5.4%, though in comparison with other economies it was reasonably satisfactory. The events of terrorist attacks in the USA and India on September 11 and December 13, 2001 respectively, impacted the global as well as Indian economy to slide down considerably. The tension on the Indian border resulted in restrictions on travel being imposed by most developed economies and that worsened the situation for the Indian economy which is still continuing to suffer from its effects. On top of that, currently the country is facing one of the worst drought situations in the last decade. The comfortable level of stocks in our granaries will, however, safeguard the country from any shortages on the food front. The year 2001-02 another in succession, witnessed a general slow down in the economy and fall in consumer spending. A large number of popular brands in the fast moving consumer goods category lost their respective market shares.\n\n<a id='06c5dd4e-2b17-48e0-8dbf-947954d3ca62'></a>\n\nHaving embarked on economic reforms and globalisation of the Indian economy for more than a decade now, investments in infrastructure as well as reforms in the agriculture sector continue to be delayed and highly deficient. Inaction on the part of the Government in accelerating the process of the reforms has started affecting growth in both manufacturing as well as agriculture sectors. The lack of long term perspective and stable and transparent policies of the Government has also resulted in both Indian as well as overseas investors shying away. This has also resulted in stagnating average per capita income of the Indian people. We have, however, been able to contain inflation. Ours is primarily an agrarian economy. We need to accelerate the process of agricultural reforms and investments in the rural infrastructure. We also have to adequately support immediately all the agro based industries on a continuing basis.\n\n<a id='b908619a-4ad3-4bc4-919a-5b0184901e66'></a>\n\n<::Net Worth* (Rs in lacs) bar chart\n\n| Year      | Net Worth (Rs in lacs) |\n| :-------- | :--------------------- |\n| 1997-98   | 12785                  |\n| 1998-99   | 16003                  |\n| 1999-2000 | 18538                  |\n| 2000-2001 | 21361                  |\n| 2001-2002 | 23934                  |\n\n* Excluding Revaluation Reserve\n: chart::>\n\n<a id='a1464a3b-e005-43e8-9480-2f99ca006d73'></a>\n\n**CIGARETTE INDUSTRY IN INDIA AND ITS POTENTIAL**\nThe domestic cigarette industry witnessed one of the sharpest declines in the sales volume in the last year when it lost more than 12% of its size as a result of steep hike in the rate of excise duty, as much as 15% across all segments. In addition, certain State Governments increased local levies such as luxury tax, entry tax and octroi tax on cigarettes. As a result, the industry was left with no choice but to raise prices of most of their brands.\n\n<a id='3f409dd1-11e8-48b2-8538-f9570bc8ffd6'></a>\n\nThe sharp increase in cigarette prices triggered an unprecedented supply of cheap smuggled cigarettes in abundance from neighboring countries. Most of them were in king size filter format selling in the market for Rs. 5 to Rs. 10 for a packet of 10 cigarettes while domestic excise duty alone works out to Rs. 14.50 for a pack of 10 sticks. Since the smuggled cigarettes offer very high margin for traders, there is a natural inducement for them to push these products. Your company has taken a number of steps on its own as well as along with other companies and enforcement agencies to curb the menace of smuggled cigarettes.\n\n<a id='14cc9d06-5eed-457f-8a9a-cb7e540d381d'></a>\n\nIndia is the second largest producer of tobacco, yet our share in the international trade continues to be less than 1%. A pragmatic and sensible approach towards tobacco will not only help the country to accelerate its export earnings but can also help raise revenue and earnings of millions of farmers.\n\n<a id='52782455-47e2-473e-a519-e52a36adfeb6'></a>\n\nCigarettes is the most preferred form of tobacco consumption all over the World except in India. India is the third largest tobacco consuming country. Yet the share of cigarettes in the total consumption has been declining year after year and has gone down to a mere 16% as against an average of 90% in the rest of the World. The prohibitive and excessive taxation on cigarettes is compelling the consumer to downgrade to other cheaper and inferior tobacco products. This is also discouraging the farmers of flue cured tobacco from making any investment in improving productivity and technological development. It may be worthwhile to note here that the per hectare earnings of farmers from flue cured tobacco is almost twice that of what he can earn by growing other types of tobaccos. This indifferent and impractical approach of the Government has also affected the growth and earnings of the domestic cigarette industry. The lack of clarity and absence of any durable policy of the Government for this sector has also discouraged the Indian industry from making any investments in developing the export market, which you will appreciate is highly competitive and dominated by major global corporations. With the capacity and skill available within the industry, we are confident that Indian companies can gain a respectable share in international trade and enhance the country's export earnings manifold with the desired support from the Government. Brazil and China are classic examples as they have achieved a significant presence in the global market with their consistent efforts in that direction. The Government must focus its attention urgently to the need of the industry by providing an environment in which it can adequately grow and face global competition within and outside the country. There is an imminent need to rationalize the tax structure whereby the wide differential in the taxation of various tobacco products inter-se is gradually reduced and the States are discouraged from levying tax on cigarettes indiscriminately and differentially. This can be resolved by having a single point of taxation in a harmonized tax structure across the country.\n\n<a id='3745cb6c-1c17-4b5f-bf92-afc97af78983'></a>\n\n**TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT AND ASSISTANCE TO FARMERS**\n\nHaving identified the potential of tobacco in India, your company has been making investments in modernizing its manufacturing facilities and development of new varieties of cigarette products. We also voluntarily started imparting training and providing technology to the farmers of flue cured tobaccos in Andhra and Karnataka to help them improve their yields, grow right varieties of tobacco and follow superior farming practices including grading and packing of tobacco.

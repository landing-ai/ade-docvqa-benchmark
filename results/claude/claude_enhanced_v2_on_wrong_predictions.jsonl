Among these, cells like id='0-5' (containing '6'), id='0-9' (containing '1'), id='0-d' (containing '8'), id='0-h' (containing '9') are all single characters.

This is confirmed by its position in row 3 of the OZARK section, with the value clearly stated in the 'No.' sub-column under 'Participants In Food Donation Program'. The table structure is well-organized with clear column headers and regional groupings, making verification straightforward.\n\nContext: While Howell has the highest absolute number of participants (2,749), it's worth noting that Reynolds County has the highest participation rate at 74.2% of its poverty population, though this percentage metric was not what the question requested.", "correct": false, "image": "data/docvqa/val/documents/jjvg0227_4.png"}

The date reference '12-1' in the header (cell 0-6) suggests this covers the period including 12/2. The total cafe charges would be $1.38 + $0.72 + $2.14 = $4.24, though the question asks specifically for 12/2 charges.

This requires locating heart diseases in the mortality data table and extracting its associated percentage value.\n\nPhase 0 (Question Comprehension): The question seeks a numeric percentage value for a specific cause of death (heart diseases) within a defined time period (Indian 1951-53). The expected answer type is a percentage number.\n\nPhase 1 (Markdown Analysis): I identified Table 2 titled 'Leading causes of death, Indian 1951-53, all races 1952, United States' which contains mortality data for the requested period. The table has two main sections: 'Indian 1951-53' and 'All races 1952'. Scanning the Indian 1951-53 column, I found 'Heart diseases' listed as a cause of death, but the corresponding percentage cell appears to contain only dots/formatting characters rather than a numeric value.\n\nPhase 2 (Visual Structure): The table is structured with causes of death in the left column and their corresponding rates in adjacent columns. Heart diseases appears to be the first row of actual data after the header. However, the cell that should contain the percentage (id='0-9') appears empty or contains only formatting dots from the OCR process.\n\nPhase 3 (Spatial Verification): Examining the table structure, row 3 (cells 0-8, 0-9, 0-a, 0-b) represents the heart diseases row. Cell 0-8 contains the extensive dotted text for 'Heart diseases', but cells 0-9, 0-a, and 0-b appear to be empty or contain no readable numeric data. The subsequent rows show clear numeric values (8.1 for Tuberculosis, 7.1 for early infancy diseases, etc.), but the heart diseases percentage is not visible in the provided markdown.\n\nConclusion: The document contains a table with heart diseases listed as a cause of death for Indians in 1951-53, but the corresponding percentage value is not readable in the provided document markup. This appears to be an OCR or formatting issue where the numeric value was not captured.", "correct": false, "image": "data/docvqa/val/documents/qzgf0227_19.png"}
